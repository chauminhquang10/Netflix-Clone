Through a career that has spanned nearly five decades, Miyazaki has attained international acclaim as a maker of animated feature films and, along with Isao Takahata, co-founded Studio Ghibli, an animation studio and production company. The success of Miyazaki's films has invited comparisons with American animator Walt Disney, British animator Nick Park as well as Robert Zemeckis, who pioneered Motion Capture animation, and he has been named one of the most influential people by Time Magazine. \nMiyazaki began his career at Toei Animation as an in-between artist for Gulliver's Travels Beyond the Moon where he pitched his own ideas that eventually became the movie's ending. He continued to work in various roles in the animation industry over the decade until he was able to direct his first feature film Lupin III: The Castle of Cagliostro which was published in 1979. After the success of his next film, Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, he co-founded Studio Ghibli where he continued to produce many feature films until Princess Mononoke whereafter he temporarily retired.\n\nWhile Miyazaki's films have long enjoyed both commercial and critical success in Japan, he remained largely unknown to the West until Miramax released his 1997 film, Princess Mononoke. Princess Mononoke was the highest-grossing film in Japan—until it was eclipsed by another 1997 film, Titanic—and the first animated film to win Picture of the Year at the Japanese Academy Awards. Miyazaki returned to animation with Spirited Away. The film topped Titanic's sales at the Japanese box office, also won Picture of the Year at the Japanese Academy Awards and was the first anime film to win an American Academy Award.\n\nMiyazaki's films often incorporate recurrent themes, such as humanity's relationship to nature and technology, and the difficulty of maintaining a pacifist ethic. Reflecting Miyazaki's feminism, the protagonists of his films are often strong, independent girls or young women. Miyazaki is a vocal critic of capitalism and globalization.[3] While two of his films, The Castle of Cagliostro and Castle in the Sky, involve traditional villains, his other films such as Nausicaa or Princess Mononoke present morally ambiguous antagonists with redeeming qualities.","birthday":"1941-01-05","gender":"Male","name":"Hayao Miyazaki","place_of_birth":"Tokyo, Japan","tmdbID":"608","__v":0,"createdAt":"2022-06-19T08:04:18.089Z","updatedAt":"2022-06-29T15:55:33.545Z"},{"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original//bF6RT5FvdzCRxRc6Ud6FC9JgcIh.jpg","knownFor":["62b18721cecc8b3bd8099a33"],"checked":false,"_id":"62aed881488f712204163198","biography":"Jonathan Liebesman was born in Johannesburg, South Africa on September 15, 1976. He would remain in his home country, studying filmmaking at the South African School of Motion Picture Medium and Live Performance, until 1996; that year, he traveled to New York City to visit his cousin who was attending New York University. Soon after the visit, Jonathan enrolled at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts. \nFor his student first film, Jonathan turned Roald Dahl's short story Genesis and Catastrophe (2000) into a 8-minute, award-winning short that help him land Hollywood representation; accolades included the 2000 Hollywood Film Festival's Young Filmmaker Award and the Austin Film Festival's Student Short Film Award.\n\nJonathan would make his feature-film debut in 2002 with Darkness Falls (2003), a dark twist on the Tooth Fairy tale that opened at #1 at the box office despite being critically panned. It also served as the big-screen debut for Emma Caulfield Ford, long a fan-favorite as Anya Jenkins on Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997).\n\nRings (2005), his short film that connected The Ring (2002) and its sequel, was first released as a bonus disc with the re-release of The Ring on DVD. The short caught the attention of Michael Bay and his production company, Platinum Dunes, and soon Jonathan was installed as the director of the company's project The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning (2006), a prequel to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003), the widely successful remake of the original.\n\nInitially announced as the director of the Friday the 13th reboot, Jonathan's next feature would instead be The Killing Room (2009) with Peter Stormare, Chloë Sevigny, Clea DuVall, Timothy Hutton, Nick Cannon and Shea Whigham. The psychological thriller played the festival circuit before being released on DVD in the United States.\n\nA few months before The Killing Room's Sundance world premiere in January 2009, Jonathan was announced as the director of Battle Los Angeles (2011), an alien-invasion film starring Aaron Eckhart and released by Columbia Pictures. The sci-fi/action film was a worldwide hit and put Jonathan in the running for a handful of big-studio pictures.\n\nBefore Battle LA's release, he had handed the job of directing Odysseus as Warner Bros., though that project remains in development at this time. Instead, Jonathan took the reins for Wrath of the Titans (2012), the sequel to successful but maligned Clash of the Titans (2010).","birthday":"1976-09-15","gender":"Male","name":"Jonathan Liebesman","place_of_birth":"Johannesburg, South Africa","tmdbID":"66739","__v":0,"createdAt":"2022-06-19T08:04:18.090Z","updatedAt":"2022-07-09T09:59:25.749Z"},{"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original//3npAesb4X5yvxPlUWRHTOFz9RCi.jpg","knownFor":["62b18721cecc8b3bd8099a0f"],"checked":false,"_id":"62aed881488f712204163199","biography":"Anthony Hemingway is an assistant director and director.","birthday":"","gender":"Male","name":"Anthony Hemingway","place_of_birth":"","tmdbID":"1216147","__v":0,"createdAt":"2022-06-19T08:04:18.090Z","updatedAt":"2022-07-09T09:59:46.388Z"},{"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/","knownFor":["62ba6bf788de6c01a0ac80ae","62b18721cecc8b3bd80998ec"],"checked":false,"_id":"62aed881488f71220416319b","biography":"","birthday":"","gender":"Not specified","name":"Jordan Graham","place_of_birth":"","tmdbID":"1335223","__v":0,"createdAt":"2022-06-19T08:04:18.090Z","updatedAt":"2022-06-28T02:48:24.080Z"},{"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original//90Tq9GYih9viOI825KgeV7PKIKG.jpg","knownFor":["62b18721cecc8b3bd80999ae"],"checked":false,"_id":"62aed881488f71220416319d","biography":"Tommy Wirkola (born 1979 in Alta, Norway) is a Norwegian filmmaker.","birthday":"1979-12-06","gender":"Male","name":"Tommy Wirkola","place_of_birth":"Alta, Norway","tmdbID":"76927","__v":0,"createdAt":"2022-06-19T08:04:18.091Z","updatedAt":"2022-06-22T08:12:34.661Z"},{"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original//aK2lYDBYhWU9MJdNV0y1EvXiNo0.jpg","knownFor":["62b18721cecc8b3bd8099a31"],"checked":false,"_id":"62aed881488f71220416319e","biography":"Nancy Jane Meyers is an American film director, producer and screenwriter.

Some of his other films include Sorcerer, Cruising, To Live and Die in L.A., Jade, Rules of Engagement, The Hunted, Bug, and Killer Joe. \nAs mentioned in Friedkin's voice-over commentary on the DVD re-release of Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo, Friedkin directed one of the last episodes of The Alfred Hitchcock Hour in 1965, called \"Off Season\". Hitchcock admonished Friedkin for not wearing a tie while directing.\n\nIn 1965 Friedkin moved to Hollywood and two years later released his first feature film, Good Times starring Sonny and Cher. Several other \"art\" films followed, including the adaptation of Mart Crowley's The Boys in the Band and most notably The Birthday Party, based on an unpublished screenplay by Harold Pinter, which he adapted from his own play. Friedkin, however, did not want to be known as an art house director, but rather for action and serious drama through stories about an America upended by crime, hypocrisy, the occult, and amorality. All of which he mounted up into his films to reflect what was going on in an America that was changing in the wake of Vietnam, the Sexual Revolution, and Watergate.\n\nIn 1971, his The French Connection was released to wide critical acclaim. Shot in a gritty style more suited for documentaries than Hollywood features, the film won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director. Friedkin followed up with 1973's The Exorcist, based on William Peter Blatty's best-selling novel, which revolutionized the horror genre and is considered by some critics to be one of the greatest horror movies of all time. The Exorcist was nominated for 10 Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director. It won the Best Screenplay and Best Sound Mixing.\n\nFollowing these two pictures, Friedkin, along with Francis Ford Coppola and Peter Bogdanovich, was deemed one of the premier directors of New Hollywood; In 1973 the trio announced the formation of an independent production company at Paramount, The Directors Company. Whereas Coppola directed The Conversation and Bogdanovich, the Henry James adaptation, Daisy Miller, Friedkin abruptly left the company, which was soon closed by Paramount. \n\nFriedkin's later movies did not achieve the same success. \n\nThroughout the 1980s and 1990s, Friedkin's films received mostly lackluster reviews and moderate ticket sales. However, his action/crime movie To Live and Die in L.A. (1985), starring William Petersen and Willem Dafoe, was a critical favorite and drew comparisons to Friedkin's own The French Connection (particularly for its car-chase sequence). In 2011 Friedkin directed Killer Joe, a black comedy written by Tracy Letts, and starring Matthew McConaughey. Killer Joe premiered at the 68th Venice International Film Festival, prior to its North American debut at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival. \n\nIn April 2013 Friedkin published a memoir, The Friedkin Connection. He was presented with a lifetime achievement award at the 70th Venice International Film Festival in September.","birthday":"1935-08-29","gender":"Male","name":"William Friedkin","place_of_birth":"Chicago, Illinois, USA","tmdbID":"15175","__v":0,"createdAt":"2022-06-19T08:04:18.098Z","updatedAt":"2022-07-09T10:00:06.651Z"},{"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original//embHCkQj1fs1PaISQSQQbi9TjHj.jpg","knownFor":["62b18721cecc8b3bd809999c"],"checked":false,"_id":"62aed882488f7122041631c9","biography":"Jonathan Charles \"Jon\" Turteltaub is an American film director and producer.

He was raised in an Army family, meaning that for most of his early life, his father — an officer in the Royal Engineers — was absent. Ridley's older brother, Frank, joined the Merchant Navy when he was still young and the pair had little contact. During this time the family moved around, living in (among other areas) Cumbria, Wales and Germany. He has a younger brother, Tony, also a film director. After the Second World War, the Scott family moved back to their native north-east England, eventually settling in Teesside (whose industrial landscape would later inspire similar scenes in Blade Runner). He enjoyed watching films, and his favourites include Lawrence of Arabia, Citizen Kane and Seven Samurai. Scott studied in Teesside from 1954 to 1958, at Grangefield Grammar School and later in West Hartlepool College of Art, graduating with a Diploma in Design. He progressed to an M.A. in graphic design at the Royal College of Art from 1960 to 1962. \nAt the RCA he contributed to the college magazine, ARK and helped to establish its film department. For his final show, he made a black and white short film, Boy and Bicycle, starring his younger brother, Tony Scott, and his father. The film's main visual elements would become features of Scott's later work; it was issued on the 'Extras' section of The Duellists DVD. After graduation in 1963, he secured a job as a trainee set designer with the BBC, leading to work on the popular television police series Z-Cars and the science fiction series Out of the Unknown. Scott was an admirer of Stanley Kubrick early in his development as a director. For his entry to the BBC traineeship, Scott remade Paths of Glory as a short film.\n\nHe was assigned to design the second Doctor Who serial, The Daleks, which would have entailed realising the famous alien creatures. However, shortly before Scott was due to start work, a schedule conflict meant that he was replaced on the serial by Raymond Cusick.\n\nAt the BBC, Scott was placed into a director training programme and, before he left the corporation, had directed episodes of Z-Cars, its spin-off, Softly, Softly, and adventure series Adam Adamant Lives!\n\nIn 1968, Ridley and Tony Scott founded Ridley Scott Associates (RSA), a film and commercial production company.Five members of the Scott family are directors, all working for RSA. Brother Tony has been a successful film director for more than two decades; sons, Jake and Luke are both acclaimed commercials directors as is his daughter, Jordan Scott. Jake and Jordan both work from Los Angeles and Luke is based in London.\n\nIn 1995, Shepperton Studios was purchased by a consortium headed by Ridley and Tony Scott, which extensively renovated the studios while also expanding and improving its grounds.","birthday":"1937-11-30","gender":"Male","name":"Ridley Scott","place_of_birth":"South Shields, County Durham, England, UK","tmdbID":"578","__v":0,"createdAt":"2022-06-19T08:04:18.098Z","updatedAt":"2022-07-07T15:28:53.732Z"},{"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original//ts06thbCv9Ug2mNpcbcrmLGRL4Q.jpg","knownFor":["62c9426c41395f1e04b216c6","62c9426c41395f1e04b215ef","62b18721cecc8b3bd8099918"],"checked":false,"_id":"62aed882488f7122041631ce","biography":"Bryan Singer (born September 17, 1965) is an American film director and producer.

The film received yet higher praises than its predecessor, and gave him three Academy Awards—for Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Director and Best Picture.

In 2008, he paired up with Derek Connolly, ten years after they had first met as NYU students while working as interns on Saturday Night Live, to write a buddy cop film script called Cocked and Loaded. Trevorrow said that the experience was so enjoyable that he decided to give up solo screenwriting and work with Connolly.\n\nIn 2012, Trevorrow directed Safety Not Guaranteed, a film inspired by a classified advertisement which ran in a 1997 issue of Backwoods Home Magazine that read: \"Somebody to go back in time with me. This is not a joke. P.O. Box 322, Oakview, CA 93022. You'll get paid after we get back. Must bring your own weapons. Safety not guaranteed.

His paternal grandparents were Polish. In 1967, the family moved to California, and young Gregor grew up near San Diego.

Disney ordered two more films which Verbinski shot one after another on location in the Carribean islands, for which he had to endure both tetanus and typhoid immunization shots. After having survived several hurricanes, dealing with sick and injured actors, and troubleshooting after numerous technical difficulties of the epic-scale project, Verbinski delivered. He employed the same stellar cast in the sequel Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (2006) and the third installment of the 'Pirates' franchise Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007).\n\nGore Verbinski does not like publicity.

He has been heralded as the \"Father of Cinematography\" since 1930. \nA Frenchman who also worked in the United Kingdom and the United States, Le Prince conducted his ground-breaking work in 1888 in the city of Leeds, West Yorkshire, England.\n\nIn October 1888, Le Prince filmed moving picture sequences, Roundhay Garden Scene and Traffic Crossing Leeds Bridge, using his single-lens camera and Eastman's paper film. These were several years before the work of competing inventors such as Auguste and Louis Lumière or Thomas Edison.\n\nHe was never able to perform a planned public demonstration in the United States because he mysteriously vanished from a train on 16 September 1890. His body and luggage were never found, but, over a century later, a police archive was found to contain a photograph of a drowned man who could have been him.\n\nNot long after Le Prince's disappearance, Thomas Edison tried to take credit for the invention. But Le Prince’s widow and son, Adolphe, were keen to advance his cause as the inventor of cinematography. In 1898, Adolphe appeared as a witness for the defense in a court case brought by Edison against the American Mutoscope Company, claiming that Edison was the first and sole inventor of cinematography (and thus entitled to royalties for the use of the process). He was not allowed to present the two cameras as evidence (and so establish Le Prince’s prior claim as inventor) and eventually the court ruled in favor of Edison. A year later that ruling was overturned.","birthday":"1841-08-28","gender":"Male","name":"Louis Aimé Augustin Le Prince","place_of_birth":"Metz, Moselle, Lorraine, France","tmdbID":"569209","__v":0,"createdAt":"2022-07-08T08:57:36.854Z","updatedAt":"2022-07-08T08:57:36.854Z"},{"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original//iowDlYDiew3P2sRvJdIZ1VWW1jF.jpg","knownFor":["62c9426c41395f1e04b216a9"],"checked":false,"_id":"62c7f1805e733337d8c7fba3","biography":"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

The three worked together on a number of classic Disney shorts, including The Band Concert, Music Land, and Elmer Elephant and in all, Reitherman worked on various Disney feature films produced from 1937 to 1981, including Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (Slave in the Magic Mirror) to The Fox and the Hound (co-producer). He did the climatic dinosaur fight in Igor Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring in Fantasia, the Headless Horseman chase in \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" section in The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad, the Crocodile in Peter Pan, and Maleficent as a dragon in Sleeping Beauty (the former three he animated and the latter he directed). Beginning with 1961's One Hundred and One Dalmatians, \"Woolie\", as he was called by friends, served as Disney's chief animation director. One of Reitherman's productions, the 1968 short Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day, won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film. He also served as a producer and sequence director, and starred as himself in the 1941 feature film The Reluctant Dragon. All three of Reitherman's sons — Bruce, Richard and Robert — provided voices for Disney characters, including Mowgli in The Jungle Book, Christopher Robin in Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree, and Wart in The Sword in the Stone.  Reitherman directed several Disney animated feature films including, One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961), The Sword in the Stone (1963), The Jungle Book (1967), The Aristocats (1970),Robin Hood (1973) and The Rescuers (1977). He is also known for reusing animation in movies directed by him. According to Floyd Norman, this was just one of his trademarks, and had nothing to do with time or cost savings: \"Woolie was our director on The Jungle Book. Reuse was just Woolie’s thing. He never did it to save money. I really don’t think the “Old Guard” ever had any interest in saving money. I was never a big fan of reuse, but it wasn’t my place to tell these old guys what to do.

The movie is lesser known today for its satirical bite and more for its exceptional cast of up-and-coming comedy artists at the time including Chevy Chase, Laraine Newman, John Candy, Joe Flaherty, Gerrit Graham, Howard Hesseman, and the team of Al Franken and Tom Davis. Other innocuous comedies/spoofs followed such as Chesty Anderson U.S. Navy (1976), Used Cars (1980), and Coming Attractions (1978) which, at the very least, helped to bulk up her comedy resume. She also appeared as a regular on The Fun Factory (1976), which was three parts quiz show, silly sketches, and audience participation. \nIronically, Betty achieved her stardom not in comedy but in hard-hitting drama. Doing a complete about face as tough-talking Officer Lucille Bates on the hit police series Hill Street Blues (1981), she displayed both grit and vulnerability as she stood nose-to-nose alongside the rest of the male-oriented precinct. She was nominated for six Emmys in all and won the \"Best Supporting Actress\" trophy in 1985. Some equally compelling mini-movie roles came along with this success. In the late 1980s, Betty made an abrupt and concentrated move into TV and film directing, one of her last acting roles being that of the butch, underhanded scoutmaster (and Shelley Long's misery-inducing nemesis) in the obvious comedy film Troop Beverly Hills (1989). Betty received her bookend Emmy award while directing the cable sitcom Dream On (1990). She never lost her taste for comedy satire, however. One of her major box office successes would come with the spot-on parody The Brady Bunch Movie (1995). She has continued in this lighter vein of late, guiding the one-man promotion machine Howard Stern to a surprisingly entertaining critical hit with Private Parts (1997), which was based on his memoirs, the Jennifer Love Hewitt film Can't Hardly Wait (1998), I Spy (2002), an updated remake of the 1960s TV series, and Surviving Christmas (2004).","birthday":"1947-07-27","gender":"Female","name":"Betty Thomas","place_of_birth":"St. Louis, Missouri, USA","tmdbID":"31024","__v":0,"createdAt":"2022-07-08T08:57:36.905Z","updatedAt":"2022-07-08T08:57:36.905Z"},{"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original//i7s94zyQ7Jq4U8b3xVOlVbIhtFr.jpg","knownFor":["62c9426c41395f1e04b215e2"],"checked":false,"_id":"62c7f1805e733337d8c7fc5a","biography":"Raman Hui Shing-Ngai (Traditional Chinese: 許誠毅, born 1963) is a Hong Kong animator and film director best known for co-directing Shrek the Third, and (co) directing several short films, including Kung Fu Panda: Secrets of the Furious Five, Scared Shrekless and Puss in Boots: The Three Diablos.","birthday":"1963-07-04","gender":"Male","name":"Raman Hui","place_of_birth":"Hong Kong, China","tmdbID":"12099","__v":0,"createdAt":"2022-07-08T08:57:36.905Z","updatedAt":"2022-07-08T08:57:36.905Z"},{"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/null","knownFor":["62c9426c41395f1e04b215cf"],"checked":false,"_id":"62c7f1805e733337d8c7fc6e","biography":"","birthday":null,"gender":"Male","name":"Don Paul","place_of_birth":null,"tmdbID":"2036264","__v":0,"createdAt":"2022-07-08T08:57:36.907Z","updatedAt":"2022-07-08T08:57:36.907Z"},{"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/null","knownFor":[],"checked":false,"_id":"62c7f1805e733337d8c7fc73","biography":"","birthday":null,"gender":"Male","name":"John Sanford","place_of_birth":null,"tmdbID":"80671","__v":0,"createdAt":"2022-07-08T08:57:36.908Z","updatedAt":"2022-07-08T08:57:36.908Z"},{"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original//kJp2tfLlg0smYgnhA8Fw5LBbRwC.jpg","knownFor":["62c9426c41395f1e04b216c2"],"checked":false,"_id":"62c7f1805e733337d8c7fb86","biography":"​From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.   \nAlex Gibney is an American documentary film director and producer.

October, 9 1962, Brighton, England, United Kingdom) is an English film director and writer, known for Garfield (2004) (credited as Pete Hewitt), Thunderpants (2002), Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey (1991) and The Candy Show (1989).  Upon graduating from England's National Film and Television School in 1990, Hewitt flew to Hollywood with his BAFTA award-winning short film, The Candy Show, in hand. Once there, he called executives from major U.S. studios and asked if he could show them his film. Soon after, he landed an agent and made his feature film directorial debut with Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey. Although not as big a success as the original, Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure, the movie made a profit.  He turned to TV next, directing the first two hours of the mini-series Wild Palms. He directed Disney's Tom and Huck in 1995 which was based on Mark Twain's The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. Hewitt returned to Britain to film The Borrowers, loosely based on a children's novel by Mary Norton of the same name. He remained in England to helm Whatever Happened to Harold Smith?

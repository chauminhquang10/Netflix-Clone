On television, Cobb costarred in the first four seasons of the popular, long-running western series The Virginian. He typically played arrogant, intimidating, and abrasive characters, but often had roles as respectable figures such as judges.  Born Leo Jacob in New York City, he grew up in The Bronx,  before studying at New York University and making his film debut in The Vanishing Shadow (1934).  Cobb performed in numerous theater productions and companies, including Group Theatre (New York) before serving in the First Motion Picture Unit of the Army Air Force during World War II.   \nFollowing the war, Cobb returned to film, television and theater before being accused of being a Communist in 1951 testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee by Larry Parks, himself a former Communist Party member. Cobb was called to testify before HUAC but refused to do so for two years until, with his career threatened by the blacklist, he relented in 1953 and gave testimony in which he named 20 people as former members of the Communist Party USA. Following the hearing he resumed his career and worked with Elia Kazan and Budd Schulberg, two other HUAC \"friendly witnesses\", on the 1954 film On the Waterfront, which is widely seen as an allegory and apologia for testifying.  His 1968 performance as King Lear achieved the longest run (72 performances) for the play in Broadway history.  One of his final film roles was that of police detective Lt. Kinderman in the 1973 horror film The Exorcist.\n\nCobb died of a heart attack in February 1976 in Woodland Hills, California, and was buried in Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles.

As a player, he won the Ballon d'Or three times, in 1971, 1973, and 1974. Cruyff was a proponent of the football philosophy known as Total Football explored by Rinus Michels, and is widely regarded as one of the greatest players in the history of the sport, and the greatest manager ever. \nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, Dutch football rose from a semi-professional and obscure level to become a powerhouse in the sport. Cruyff led the Netherlands to the final of the 1974 FIFA World Cup and received the Golden Ball as player of the tournament. At the 1974 finals, he executed a feint that subsequently was named after him, the \"Cruyff Turn\", a move widely replicated in the modern game. After finishing third in UEFA Euro 1976, Cruyff refused to play in the 1978 World Cup after a kidnapping attempt targeting him and his family in their Barcelona home dissuaded him from football. At club level, Cruyff started his career at Ajax, where he won eight Eredivisie titles, three European Cups, and one Intercontinental Cup. In 1973, he moved to Barcelona for a world record transfer fee, helping the team win La Liga in his first season, and was named European Footballer of the Year. After retiring from playing in 1984, Cruyff became highly successful as manager of Ajax and later Barcelona; he remained an influential advisor to both clubs after his coaching tenures. His son Jordi also played football professionally.\n\nWearing the number 14 jersey since 1970, (except at Barcelona and Feyenoord where he was assigned number 9 and 10 respectively) Cruyff set a trend by players to, if allowed, choose a jersey number outside the usual starting line-up of one to eleven. In 1999, Cruyff was voted European Player of the Century in an election held by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics, and came second behind Pelé in their World Player of the Century poll. He came third in a vote organised by the French magazine France Football consulting their former Ballon d'Or winners to elect their Football Player of the Century. He was included in the World Team of the 20th Century in 1998, the FIFA World Cup Dream Team in 2002, and in 2004 was named in the FIFA 100 list of the world's greatest living players.\n\nConsidered to be one of the most influential figures in football history, Cruyff's style of play and football philosophy has influenced managers and players alike. Ajax and Barcelona are among the clubs that have developed youth academies based on Cruyff's coaching methods. His coaching philosophy helped lay the foundations for the revival of Ajax's international successes in the 1990s, and Spanish football's successes at both club and international levels during the years 2008 to 2012 have been cited as evidence of Cruyff's impact on contemporary football. And in Johan Neeskens's own words, \"If you look at the greatest players in history, most of them couldn't coach. If you look at the greatest coaches in history, most of them were not great players. Johan Cruyff did both – and in such an exhilarating style.\"\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.","birthday":"1947-04-25","gender":"Male","name":"Johan Cruijff","place_of_birth":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","tmdbID":"1065203","__v":0,"createdAt":"2022-06-19T08:04:03.160Z","updatedAt":"2022-07-09T10:00:35.257Z"},{"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original//a1EuvL7XzKDXRPe0a6CEMJWF6Vd.jpg","knownFor":["62b18721cecc8b3bd8099a05"],"checked":false,"_id":"62aed872488f71220416300b","biography":"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia \nLionel Andrés \"Leo\" Messi (Spanish pronunciation: [ljoˈnel anˈdɾes ˈmesi] ( listen); born 24 June 1987) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a forward for French club Paris Saint-Germain and captains the Argentina national team.

After a fast progression through Barcelona's youth academy, Messi made his competitive debut aged 17 in October 2004. Despite being injury-prone during his early career, he established himself as an integral player for the club within the next three years, finishing 2007 as a finalist for both the Ballon d'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year award, a feat he repeated the following year.

She decided to stay and found employment as a manager at a Musicland record store in Redlands. She had lived in a trailer in one of the worst parts of the city for almost a year when she answered an ad for figure models. This led to employment the same day and a layout in Penthouse magazine. \nWork in the adult-film industry soon followed. She worked in the industry from December 1983 through February 1986, making a total of 69 films (plus countless re-issues and compilations). She retired, partially because the work was no longer fun and she had very little time off. That same year, she was approached by the FBI to testify on behalf of Traci Lords, who had just been exposed as having been underage during her years in the adult-film industry. She refused and was eventually arrested for tax evasion.\n\nFollowing her years in adult movies, she appeared in many \"legit\" films throughout the late 1980s and 1990s-- most notably the \"Vice Academy\" films. She also starred in Metallica's music video \"Turn the Page.\" She has a son, whom she gave birth to on March 24, 1996. She tours gentlemen's clubs around the country, and signed a comeback deal with VCA Pictures in 1999.

Considered one of the most influential actors of the 20th century, he received numerous accolades throughout his career which spanned six decades, including two Academy Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, and three British Academy Film Awards. Brando was also an activist for many causes, notably the civil rights movement and various Native American movements. Having studied with Stella Adler in the 1940s, he is credited with being one of the first actors to bring the Stanislavski system of acting and method acting, derived from the Stanislavski system, to mainstream audiences. \nHe initially gained acclaim and his first Academy Award nomination for Best Actor in a Leading Role for reprising the role of Stanley Kowalski in the 1951 film adaptation of Tennessee Williams' play A Streetcar Named Desire, a role that he originated successfully on Broadway. He received further praise, and a first Academy Award and Golden Globe Award, for his performance as Terry Malloy in On the Waterfront, and his portrayal of the rebellious motorcycle gang leader Johnny Strabler in The Wild One proved to be a lasting image in popular culture. Brando received Academy Award nominations for playing Emiliano Zapata in Viva Zapata! (1952); Mark Antony in Joseph L. Mankiewicz's 1953 film adaptation of Shakespeare's Julius Caesar; and Air Force Major Lloyd Gruver in Sayonara (1957), an adaptation of James A. Michener's 1954 novel.\n\nThe 1960s saw Brando's career take a commercial and critical downturn. He directed and starred in the cult western One-Eyed Jacks, a critical and commercial flop, after which he delivered a series of notable box-office failures, beginning with Mutiny on the Bounty (1962). After ten years of underachieving, he agreed to do a screen test as Vito Corleone in Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather (1972). He got the part and subsequently won his second Academy Award and Golden Globe Award in a performance critics consider among his greatest. He declined the Academy Award due to alleged mistreatment and misportrayal of Native Americans by Hollywood. The Godfather was one of the most commercially successful films of all time, and alongside his Oscar-nominated performance in Last Tango in Paris (1972), Brando reestablished himself in the ranks of top box-office stars.\n\nAfter a hiatus in the early 1970s, Brando was generally content with being a highly paid character actor in supporting roles, such as Jor-El in Superman (1978), as Colonel Kurtz in Apocalypse Now (1979), and Adam Steiffel in The Formula (1980), before taking a nine-year break from film. According to the Guinness Book of World Records, Brando was paid a record $3.7 million ($16 million in inflation-adjusted dollars) and 11.75% of the gross profits for 13 days' work on Superman.\n\nBrando was ranked by the American Film Institute as the fourth-greatest movie star among male movie stars whose screen debuts occurred in or before 1950. He was one of only six actors named in 1999 by Time magazine in its list of the 100 Most Important People of the Century.

Gooding Jr. was raised by his mother and attended four different high schools: North Hollywood High School, Tustin High School, Apple Valley High School, and John F. Kennedy High School in Granada Hills in Los Angeles. He served as class president in three of them. \nHis first job as a professional entertainer was as a break-dancer performing with singer Lionel Richie at the closing ceremonies of the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. After high school, Gooding studied Japanese martial arts for three years, before turning his focus toward acting. Early on, he landed guest starring roles on shows like Hill Street Blues (1981) and MacGyver (1985).\n\nHis first major role was in the John Singleton's box office surprise and critical hit Boyz n the Hood (1991).

As an actor, his work in the film Ray earned him the Academy Award and BAFTA Award for Best Actor as well as the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a musical/comedy. He is also a Grammy Award winning musician, producing two albums which have charted highly on the Billboard 200: Unpredictable, which topped the chart, and Intuition. \nFoxx was abandoned seven months after birth, and was subsequently adopted and raised in Terrell by his mother's adoptive parents, Estelle and Mark Talley. Foxx had a strict Baptist upbringing and began piano lessons at the age of five by his grandmother's orders. He has often acknowledged his grandmother's influence in his life as one of the greatest reasons for his success. When he found that female comedians were often called first to perform, he changed his name to Jamie Foxx, feeling that it was an ambiguous enough name to disallow any biases. He chose his surname as a tribute to comedian Redd Foxx.\n\nFrom 1996 to 2001, Foxx starred in his own sitcom The Jamie Foxx Show, and in 1992 he made his film debut in Toys a comedy directed by Barry Levinson. Following Toys, his first dramatic role came in Oliver Stone's 1999 film Any Given Sunday, where he portrayed a hard-partying American football player. Foxx has since evolved into a respected dramatic actor. Foxx was featured as taxi driver Max Durocher in the film Collateral alongside Tom Cruise, for which he received outstanding reviews and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. His standout performance, however, was his portrayal of Ray Charles in the biopic Ray (2004), for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor and the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. Foxx is the second male in history to receive two acting Oscar nominations in the same year for two different movies, Collateral and Ray.\n\nIn September 2007, Foxx was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.","birthday":"1967-12-13","gender":"Male","name":"Jamie Foxx","place_of_birth":"Terrell, Texas, USA","tmdbID":"134","__v":0,"createdAt":"2022-06-19T08:04:03.168Z","updatedAt":"2022-07-09T10:00:58.296Z"},{"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original//9oWhFs2oRzaYOKqs0bGDZ2KGvuZ.jpg","knownFor":["62b18721cecc8b3bd80999c5"],"checked":false,"_id":"62aed872488f712204163070","biography":"Victor Rivers (born Victor Rivas in Sancti Spíritus, Cuba) is an actor, known for The Mask of Zorro (1998), Blood In, Blood Out (1993) and Hulk (2003).

He was briefly married to Natasha Henstridge. Among his earlier notable film roles are one of the leads in Taylor Hackford's Blood In Blood Out and the part of Ken in the film adaptation of Street Fighter. Subsequently, Chapa has directed and produced, in addition to starring in, his own films. These movies include 1998's Kill You Twice, 2000's The Lonely Life of Downey Hall, 2002's Man of Faith, 2004's Shade of Pale, 2004's El Padrino, and 2006's I.R.A.: King of Nothing.\n\nChapa co-wrote and directed Polanski Unauthorized, a biopic of Roman Polanski, in which he played the title role. It was released on February 13, 2009, in Los Angeles, California. Chapa will begin filming the only film about Marlon Brando ever to be made, in June 2010 called Brando Unauthorized. He followed this with \"Vatos Locos\", starring himself. Albert Pyun was supposed to direct, but left the project following a dispute over his salary, so Chapa directed himself. The film is about the Chinese mafia in Los Angeles and how the Mexican gang boys, known as \"vatos,\" fought back and defeated the Chinese gang-bangers.\n\nAs of 2011, Chapa has yet another project in development, an indie drama titled \"The Best So Far,\" which takes place in the late 80's, about a small-town Canadian girl who loves Judo and dreams about being one of the finalists at the '88 Olympics. The ensemble drama follows the lines of Rocky, in the sense that it's not about winning, but going the distance and getting your life back. Chapa, who wrote the drama, will play the widowed father, who does his best to make life easier for his daughter. Although the film is in its very early development stages, Chapa hopes the script will attract the interest of talented artists such as Ellen Page for the main role and Jennifer Connelly for the supporting role, this being the part of the final, toughest competition Page's character faces off during the '88 Olympics and gets defeated by. Although not winning, she gets her sense of victory be offering a brave stand against the better fighter, and both discover, in the process, they are quite simillar, despite their differences. Insiders who had a chance to read the script stated that it is one of the finest not-yet-filmed scripts they had ever seen. Acclaimed director David Cronenberg asked for New Line to bid for the script, but Chapa wouldn't sell it, because of his determination to direct the picture himself. The project is slated to be shot sometime in mid-2012, for tentative release in 2013 at the Sundance Film Festival.\n\n ,  ​","birthday":"1963-10-29","gender":"Male","name":"Damian Chapa","place_of_birth":"Dayton, Ohio, USA","tmdbID":"58646","__v":0,"createdAt":"2022-06-19T08:04:03.168Z","updatedAt":"2022-07-09T10:00:56.670Z"},{"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original//8dJZL8ilgG2S4mYx6UjdFVvjg0Q.jpg","knownFor":["62b18721cecc8b3bd80999c4"],"checked":false,"_id":"62aed872488f712204163074","biography":"Sophie Cookson (born 15 May 1990) is an English film and television actress.

He is known for providing the voice of Darth Vader in the Star Wars franchise and the tagline for CNN.  James Earl Jones was born in Arkabutla, Mississippi, the son of Ruth (née Connolly) and Robert Earl Jones. At the age of five, he moved to Jackson, Michigan, to be raised by his maternal grandparents, but the adoption was traumatic and he developed a stutter so severe he refused to speak aloud. When he moved to Brethren, Michigan in later years a teacher at the Brethren schools started to help him with his stutter. He remained functionally mute for eight years until he reached high school. He credits his high school teacher, Donald Crouch, who discovered he had a gift for writing poetry, with helping him out of his silence.  Jones attended the University of Michigan where he was a pre-med major. While there, he joined the Reserve Officer Training Corps, and excelled. During the course of his studies, Jones discovered he was not cut out to be a doctor. Instead he focused himself on drama, with the thought of doing something he enjoyed, before, he assumed, he would have to go off to fight in the Korean War. After four years of college, Jones left without his degree. In 1953 he found a part-time stage crew job at the Ramsdell Theatre in Manistee, Michigan, which marked the beginning of his acting career. During the 1955–1957 seasons he was an actor and stage manager. He performed his first portrayal of Shakespeare’s Othello in this theater in 1955. After his discharge from the Military, Jones moved to New York, where he attended the American Theatre Wing to further his training and worked as a janitor to earn a living. His first film role was as a young and trim Lt. Lothar Zogg, the B-52 bombardier in Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb in 1964. His first big role came with his portrayal of boxer Jack Jefferson in the film version of the Broadway play The Great White Hope, which was based on the life of boxer Jack Johnson. For his role, Jones was nominated Best Actor by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, making him the second African-American male performer (following Sidney Poitier) to receive a nomination. In 1969, Jones participated in making test films for a proposed children's television series; these shorts, combined with animated segments were the beginnings of the Sesame Street format. The next year, in the early 1970s, James appeared with Diahann Carroll in the film called Claudine.  While he has appeared in many roles, he is well known as the voice of Darth Vader in the original Star Wars trilogy. Darth Vader was portrayed in costume by David Prowse in the original trilogy, with Jones dubbing Vader's dialogue in postproduction due to Prowse's strong West Country accent being unsuitable for the role. At his own request, he was originally uncredited for the release of the first two films (he would later be credited for the two in the 1997 re-release).  His other voice roles include Mufasa in the 1994 film Disney animated blockbuster The Lion King, and its direct-to-video sequel, The Lion King II: Simba's Pride. He also has done the CNN tagline, \"This is CNN\", as well as \"This is CNN International\", and the Bell Atlantic tagline, \"Bell Atlantic: The heart of communication\". When Bell Atlantic became Verizon, Jones used the tagline greeting of \"Welcome to Verizon\" or \"Verizon 411\" right before a phone call would go through. The opening for NBC's coverage of the 2000 and 2004 Summer Olympics; \"the Big PI in the Sky\" (God) in the computer game Under a Killing Moon; a Claymation film about The Creation; and several guest spots on The Simpsons.  In addition to his film and voice over work, Jones is an accomplished stage actor as well; he has won Tony awards in 1969 for The Great White Hope and in 1987 for Fences. Othello, King Lear, Oberon in A Midsummer Night's Dream, Abhorson in Measure for Measure, and Claudius in Hamlet are Shakespearean roles he has played. He received Kennedy Center Honors in 2002.

From 2004 to 2020, he has won awards every one or two alternative years. \nToday, Ryu remains an iconic and beloved actor in the Japanese industry. He has the reputation of a reliable lead actor who goes into character as soon as the cameras start rolling. For his successful transition from a child actor to a main lead combined with his modest personality, has made him a role model for many. When choosing works, he likes to experiment with roles or plots. He does not mind too much about popularity or being the main lead as long as he likes his role. Rather than \"aiming for a big goal ahead\", he is the type to do the job in front of him wholeheartedly.\n\nHe has appeared in numerous award-winning projects. In 2011, he won his first international award for playing the main lead in the Amade Prize–winning \"Threads of Our Hearts\". To date, he has been an integral part of all the top 4 highest-grossing Japanese movies in Japan. His works continue to break records as his movie \"your name.\" became the highest-grossing Japanese movie of all time internationally.\n\nRyu, alongside acting and voice acting, has dabbled in multiple fields. For variety shows he often does many documentaries. He even interviewed Will Smith for the magazine TV program 'ZIP!'. In 2015, he released his first book \"Master's Café\". Ryu challenged his first stage play with \"Beautiful: The Woman Who Met with God\", directed and written by Suzuki Matsuo, in 2019.

Rasuk was born in Harlem, New York to Dominican parents. He has one brother, Silvestre, with whom he starred in Raising Victor Vargas. Rasuk attended performing arts school as a teenager, and began acting at 14. He garnered his first movie role at 16 in Five Feet High and Rising. The film—less than 30 minutes long—was a hit at the Independent Spirit Film Festival. Two years later, the same director, Peter Sollett, suggested expanding the short film into a feature-length movie: Raising Victor Vargas, which went on to win Rasuk an Independent Spirit Award for his work. In his next film, Rock Steady, Rasuk played a character named Roc. Two years later, he took a leading role in Haven with Orlando Bloom. In 2005, Lords of Dogtown was released, with Victor playing Tony Alva, one of the leading roles. The part included surfing and performing skateboarding tricks. Although the more complicated maneuvers were performed by stunt men (including the scenes of surfing at Pacific Ocean Park pier and skating in empty swimming pools), Rasuk is a method actor and worked on remaining in character both on and off screen. Believing he had mastered skating a huge ramp in only his second week of training, Rasuk fractured one of his orbital bones. Rasuk says the accident likely earned him more respect from serious skaters within the cast and crew.

Johnson is half-Black and half-Samoan. His father, Rocky Johnson, is a Black Canadian, from Nova Scotia, and part of the first Black tag team champions in WWE history back when it was known as the WWF along with Tony Atlas. His mother is Samoan and the daughter of Peter Maivia, who was also a pro wrestler. Maivia's wife, Lia Maivia, was one of wrestling's few female promoters, taking over Polynesian Pacific Pro Wrestling after her husband's death in 1982, until 1988. Through his mother, he is considered a non-blood relative of the Anoa'i wrestling family. On March 29, 2008, The Rock inducted his father and his grandfather into the WWE Hall of Fame. \nAs of 2014, Johnson has a home in Southwest Ranches, Florida as well as Los Angeles, California. He also owns a farm in Virginia. In 2009, Johnson gained citizenship in Canada in honor of his father's background. Though Johnson was previously registered as a Republican, he voted for Barack Obama in the 2008 and 2012 United States presidential elections and is now an independent voter. He stated he did not vote in the 2016 U.S. election.\n\nIn recognition of his service to the Samoan people, and because he is a descendant of Samoan chiefs, Johnson had the noble title of Seiuli bestowed upon him by Malietoa Tanumafili II during his visit there in July 2004. He received a partial Samoan pe'a tattoo on his left side in 2003,and, in 2017, had the small \"Brahma bull\" tattoo on his right arm covered with a larger half-sleeve tattoo of a bull's skull.\n\nJohnson married Dany Garcia on May 3, 1997. Their only child together, a daughter named Simone, was born in August 2001. On June 1, 2007, they announced they were splitting up amicably. Johnson then began dating Lauren Hashian, daughter of Boston drummer Sib Hashian. They first met in 2006 while Johnson was filming The Game Plan. Their first child together, a daughter, was born in December 2015. Their second child, another daughter, was born in April 2018.\n\nJohnson attended the 2000 Democratic National Convention as part of WWE's non-partisan \"Smackdown Your Vote\" campaign, which aimed to influence young people to vote. He also had a speaking role at the 2000 Republican National Convention that same year.\n\nIn 2006, Johnson founded the Dwayne Johnson Rock Foundation, a charity working with at-risk and terminally ill children. On October 2, 2007, he and his ex-wife donated $1 million to the University of Miami to support the renovation of its football facilities; it was noted as the largest donation ever given to the university's athletics department by former students. The University of Miami renamed the Hurricanes' locker room in Johnson's honor. In 2015, Johnson donated $1,500 to a GoFundMe to pay for an abandoned dog's surgery. In 2017, he donated $25,000 to Hurricane Harvey relief efforts. In 2018, Johnson donated a gym to a military base in Oahu, Hawaii.

Jackie Chan has been acting since the 1970s and has appeared in over 100 films. \nChan has received stars on the Hong Kong Avenue of Stars and the Hollywood Walk of Fame. As a cultural icon, Chan has been referenced in various pop songs, cartoons, and video games. Chan is also a Cantopop and Mandopop star, having released a number of albums and sung many of the theme songs for the films in which he has starred.\n\nChan was born on April 7, 1954, in Victoria Peak, in the former Crown colony of Hong Kong, as Chan Kong-sang (meaning \"born in Hong Kong\") to Charles and Lee-Lee Chan, refugees from the Chinese Civil War. He was nicknamed Paopao (Chinese: 炮炮, literally meaning \"Cannonball\") because he was such a big baby, weighing 12 pounds, or about 5.4 kgs. Since his parents worked for the French Consul to Hong Kong, Chan spent his formative years within the grounds of the consul's residence in the Victoria Peak district. Chan attended the Nah-Hwa Primary School on Hong Kong Island, where he failed his first year, after which his parents withdrew him from the school.\n\nIn 1960, his father immigrated to Canberra, Australia, to work as the head cook for the American embassy, and Chan was sent to the China Drama Academy, a Peking Opera School run by Master Yu Jim-yuen. Chan trained rigorously for the next decade, excelling in martial arts and acrobatics. He eventually became part of the Seven Little Fortunes, a performance group made up of the school's best students, gaining the stage name Yuen Lo in homage to his master. Chan became close friends with fellow group members Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao, the three of them later to be known as the Three Brothers or Three Dragons.

Bana performs predominantly in leading roles in a variety of low-budget and major studio films, ranging from romantic comedies and drama to science fiction and action thrillers.\n\nEric Bana was the younger of two children; he has a brother, Anthony. He is of Croatian ancestry on his father's side. Bana's paternal grandfather, Mate Banadinović, fled to Argentina after the Second World War, and Bana's paternal grandmother emigrated to Germany and then to Australia in the 1950s with her son, Ivan (Bana's father). His father was a logistics manager for Caterpillar, Inc., and his German-born mother, Eleanor, was a hairdresser. Bana grew up in Melbourne's Tullamarine, a suburban area on the western edge of the city, near the main airport. In a cover story for The Mail on Sunday, he told author Antonella Gambotto-Burke that his family had suffered from racist taunts, and that it had distressed him. \"Wog is such a terrible word,\" he said. He has stated: \"I have always been proud of my origin, which had a big influence on my upbringing. I have always been in the company of people of European origin\".\n\nShowing acting skill early in life, Bana began doing impressions of family members at the age of six or seven, first mimicking his grandfather's walk, voice and mannerisms. In school, he mimicked his teachers as a means to get out of trouble. As a teen, he watched the Mel Gibson film Mad Max (1979), and decided he wanted to become an actor. However, he did not seriously consider a career in the performing arts until 1991 when he was persuaded to try stand-up comedy while working as a barman at Melbourne's Castle Hotel. His stand-up gigs in inner-city pubs did not provide him with enough income to support himself, so he continued his work as a barman and bussing tables.","birthday":"1968-08-09","gender":"Male","name":"Eric Bana","place_of_birth":"Melbourne, Australia","tmdbID":"8783","__v":0,"createdAt":"2022-06-19T08:04:03.201Z","updatedAt":"2022-07-06T08:17:52.561Z"},{"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original//w3HyVAbiVgM3Q1SIkl3GFr17D5w.jpg","knownFor":["62b18721cecc8b3bd8099a63","62b18721cecc8b3bd8099a64","62b18721cecc8b3bd8099a65","62b18721cecc8b3bd8099a11"],"checked":false,"_id":"62aed872488f712204163188","biography":"Orlando Jonathan Blanchard Copeland Bloom (born 13 January 1977) is an English actor.

Trevorrow (US: /trəˈvɑːroʊ/; born September 13, 1976) is an American film director and screenwriter. He directed the indie film Safety Not Guaranteed (2012) and the blockbuster film Jurassic World (2015), and also co-wrote the script to Jurassic World and its 2018 sequel.\n\nTrevorrow was born on September 13, 1976 in San Francisco, California. He was raised in Oakland, California. His father was a musician in a country rock band and his mother was a photographer who also operated a day-care center. He is Jewish on his mother's side.\n\nAs a boy, he sang in the chorus of the San Francisco Opera. As a teenager, Trevorrow won awards from the Mill Valley Film Festival and the San Francisco Youth Film Festival. Trevorrow graduated from Piedmont High School in Piedmont, California, and later graduated from New York University's Tisch School of the Arts in 1999.\n\nIn 2002, he wrote and directed his first short film, Home Base; as of 2012, it had received over 20 million hits online. Trevorrow's first theatrical release was with Reality Show, a 2004 documentary film about the failed production of a reality television show. Trevorrow sold his first spec script titled Tester to DreamWorks in 2006. In 2008, he paired up with Derek Connolly, ten years after they had first met as NYU students while working as interns on Saturday Night Live, to write a buddy cop film script called Cocked and Loaded. Trevorrow said that the experience was so enjoyable that he decided to give up solo screenwriting and work with Connolly.\n\nIn 2012, Trevorrow directed Safety Not Guaranteed, a film inspired by a classified advertisement which ran in a 1997 issue of Backwoods Home Magazine that read: \"Somebody to go back in time with me. This is not a joke. P.O. Box 322, Oakview, CA 93022. You'll get paid after we get back. Must bring your own weapons. Safety not guaranteed. I have only done this once before.\" The script was by Connolly, who intended for Trevorrow to direct it. The film received various accolades, including a nomination for Trevorrow for the Independent Spirit Award for Best First Feature. The film was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance, where it picked up the Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award. After the release of Safety Not Guaranteed, Trevorrow and Connolly were hired by the Walt Disney Company to write an as-yet unmade remake of the film Flight of the Navigator (1986). Trevorrow co-wrote and directed Jurassic World (2015), and also provided his voice for the film's character of Mr. DNA. Connolly and Trevorrow also co-wrote the screenplay for its sequel, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, which was released in June 2018 and for which Trevorrow is an executive producer.\n\nAfter Jurassic World, Trevorrow next directed The Book of Henry, which was written by Gregg Hurwitz. The film was released by Focus Features on June 16, 2017 to generally negative reviews, although Trevorrow stood by the film.\n\nOn March 30, 2018 it was announced that Trevorrow would be returning to the Jurassic Park franchise to direct Jurassic World 3 (2021).\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Colin Trevorow, licensed under CC-BY-SA, ful list of contributors on Wikipedia.","tmdbID":"930707","createdAt":"2022-06-26T16:14:49.665Z","updatedAt":"2022-06-26T16:14:49.665Z","__v":0},{"image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/minh-quang-21-kg/image/upload/v1655541960/movie/unknown_p0ax5n.jpg","knownFor":[],"checked":false,"_id":"62ba6cdb88de6c01a0ac80b0","name":"kevin nash","gender":"Male","place_of_birth":"Detroit, Michigan USA","birthday":"1959-07-09","biography":"Kevin Scott Nash is an inactive American professional wrestler and actor, who is signed to WWE.

Widely regarded as one of the greatest players in the history of the sport, he was one of the two joint winners of the FIFA Player of the 20th Century award. Maradona's vision, passing, ball control, and dribbling skills were combined with his small stature, which gave him a low centre of gravity allowing him to manoeuvre better than most other players. His presence and leadership on the field had a great effect on his team's general performance, while he would often be singled out by the opposition. In addition to his creative abilities, he possessed an eye for goal and was known to be a free kick specialist. A precocious talent, Maradona was given the nickname \"El Pibe de Oro\" (\"The Golden Boy\"), a name that stuck with him throughout his career. He also had a troubled off-field life and was banned in both 1991 and 1994 for abusing drugs.  An advanced playmaker who operated in the classic number 10 position, Maradona was the first player to set the world record transfer fee twice: in 1982 when he transferred to Barcelona for £5 million, and in 1984 when he moved to Napoli for a fee of £6.9 million. He played for Argentinos Juniors, Boca Juniors, Barcelona, Napoli, Sevilla, and Newell's Old Boys during his club career, and is most famous for his time at Napoli where he won numerous accolades. \nIn his international career with Argentina, he earned 91 caps and scored 34 goals. Maradona played in four FIFA World Cups, including the 1986 World Cup in Mexico, where he captained Argentina and led them to victory over West Germany in the final, and won the Golden Ball as the tournament's best player. In the 1986 World Cup quarter final, he scored both goals in a 2–1 victory over England that entered football history for two different reasons. The first goal was an unpenalized handling foul known as the \"Hand of God\", while the second goal followed a 60 m (66 yd) dribble past five England players, voted \"Goal of the Century\" by FIFA.com voters in 2002.\n\nMaradona became the coach of Argentina's national football team in November 2008. He was in charge of the team at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa before leaving at the end of the tournament. He then coached Dubai-based club Al Wasl in the UAE Pro-League for the 2011–12 season. In 2017, Maradona became the coach of Fujairah before leaving at the end of the season. In May 2018, Maradona was announced as the new chairman of Belarusian club Dynamo Brest. He arrived in Brest and was presented by the club to start his duties in July. From September 2018 to June 2019, Maradona was coach of Mexican club Dorados. He was the coach of Argentine Primera División club Gimnasia de La Plata from September 2019 until his death in November 2020.\n\nFrom Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia.","birthday":"1960-10-30","gender":"Male","name":"Diego Maradona","place_of_birth":"Lanús, Buenos Aires, Argentina","tmdbID":"56218","__v":0,"createdAt":"2022-07-08T08:42:10.859Z","updatedAt":"2022-07-08T08:42:10.859Z"},{"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original//c01Ma8Jrr2OJ6uoikPwDK34Y8eK.jpg","knownFor":["62c9426c41395f1e04b216d3"],"checked":false,"_id":"62c7ede2f711ce4300f6169c","biography":"Kaley Cuoco is an American film and television actress and singer.

Regarded as one of the greatest players of all time and labelled \"the greatest\" by FIFA, he was among the most successful and popular sports figures of the 20th century. In 1999 he was named Athlete of the Century by the International Olympic Committee and was included in the Time list of the 100 most important people of the 20th century. In 2000, Pelé was voted World Player of the Century by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics (IFFHS), and was one of the two joint winners of the FIFA Player of the Century. His total of 1,279 goals in 1,363 games, which included friendlies, is recognised as a Guinness World Record.  Pelé began playing for Santos at age 15 and the Brazil national team at 16. During his international career, he won three FIFA World Cups: 1958, 1962 and 1970, the only player to do so. Pelé is the all-time leading goalscorer for Brazil with 77 goals in 92 games. At club level he is Santos' all-time top goalscorer with 643 goals from 659 games. In a golden era for Santos, he led the club to the 1962 and 1963 Copa Libertadores, and to the 1962 and 1963 Intercontinental Cup. Credited with connecting the phrase \"The Beautiful Game\" with football, Pelé's \"electrifying play and penchant for spectacular goals\" made him a star around the world, and his teams toured internationally in order to take full advantage of his popularity. During his playing days, Pelé was for a period the best-paid athlete in the world. Since retiring in 1977, Pelé has been a worldwide ambassador for football and has made many acting and commercial ventures. In 2010, he was named the Honorary President of the New York Cosmos. \nAveraging almost a goal per game throughout his career, Pelé was adept at striking the ball with either foot in addition to anticipating his opponents' movements on the field. While predominantly a striker, he could also drop deep and take on a playmaking role, providing assists with his vision and passing ability, and he would also use his dribbling skills to go past opponents. In Brazil, he is hailed as a national hero for his accomplishments in football and for his outspoken support of policies that improve the social conditions of the poor. His emergence at the 1958 World Cup where he became the first black global sporting star was a source of inspiration. Throughout his career and in his retirement, Pelé received several individual and team awards for his performance in the field, his record-breaking achievements, and legacy in the sport.\n\nFrom Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia.","birthday":"1940-10-23","gender":"Male","name":"Pelé","place_of_birth":"Três Corações, Minas Gerais, Brazil","tmdbID":"140152","__v":0,"createdAt":"2022-07-08T08:42:10.859Z","updatedAt":"2022-07-08T08:42:10.859Z"},{"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original//rMLtdNhtvy60qI0UGea6YavHVY9.jpg","knownFor":["62c9426c41395f1e04b216ce"],"checked":false,"_id":"62c7ede2f711ce4300f616b1","biography":"","birthday":null,"gender":"Not specified","name":"Lil Tracy","place_of_birth":null,"tmdbID":"2452754","__v":0,"createdAt":"2022-07-08T08:42:10.867Z","updatedAt":"2022-07-08T08:42:10.867Z"},{"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original//sob77LHncgMNFhPoxk46TGONz6X.jpg","knownFor":["62c9426c41395f1e04b216ce"],"checked":false,"_id":"62c7ede2f711ce4300f616b2","biography":"Gustav Åhr (November 1, 1996 – November 15, 2017), better known by his stage name Lil Peep, was an American rapper and singer from Long Beach, Long Island, New York.

The blond-maned, blue-eyed comedian with the sad, droopy mustache first came in contact with the arts by honing in on his innate talents as a painter. In order to pay his art school tuition, he started organizing bands. At around the same time, he discovered that stand-up comedy was another way to allow his creative juices to flow.  Martin's early recognition as a humorist led to a recording contract, and, over the years, he would be Grammy-nominated several times for a number of eccentric comedy albums. His gimmick and allure came in the form of a dry, humorless delivery and a bland, highly conservative-looking demeanor, which masked a sly, witty and ultra-hip philosophy. \nGaining popularity in the 1970s, he finally broke into TV with the cult soap opera parody \"Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman\" (1976) in which he played Garth Gimble, a volatile wife abuser whose comeuppance occurred in the form of an aluminum Christmas tree (impaled) in his home closet. Martin was so popular on the show that he was resurrected in the spin-off series \"Fernwood 2 Night\" (1977) as twin brother Barth Gimble, who was a co-host of the town's television program along with Fred Willard's Jerry Hubbard character.\n\nAfter this peak, Martin became a sought-after guest on the talk show circuit, not to mention variety specials and TV movies. He tried his hand at producing and starring in his own sitcom \"Domestic Life\" (1984) but the series failed. He also added his special brand of merriment to films over the years, some of them being decent, such as FM (1978), Serial (1980), Mr. Mom (1983) and Clue (1985) in the role of the tweedy-looking Colonel Mustard, while most have been either formula schtick or just plain drivel, as in Take This Job and Shove It (1981), Rented Lips (1988), which he produced and wrote, Cutting Class (1989), Far Out Man (1990) with Cheech & Chong, and Mr. Write (1994).\n\nMartin's first passion has always been art and the distinguished multi-media artist's work has been showcased in galleries throughout the world. He also authored the book \"Painting, Drawing and World,\" which is a compilation of ten years of his work. Mull is married to a composer and musician, Wendy, and they have a daughter. - IMDb Mini Biography By: Gary Brumburgh","birthday":"1943-08-18","gender":"Male","name":"Martin Mull","place_of_birth":"Chicago, Illinois, USA","tmdbID":"80742","__v":0,"createdAt":"2022-07-08T08:52:56.055Z","updatedAt":"2022-07-08T08:52:56.055Z"},{"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/null","knownFor":["62c9426c41395f1e04b21682"],"checked":false,"_id":"62c7f0679ddc7a10d49dcc94","biography":"","birthday":null,"gender":"Not specified","name":"Tim Jenison","place_of_birth":null,"tmdbID":"1204262","__v":0,"createdAt":"2022-07-08T08:52:56.055Z","updatedAt":"2022-07-08T08:52:56.055Z"},{"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original//pSC05Cm8h8XEK6CS6Ak3qULbHfR.jpg","knownFor":["62c9426c41395f1e04b21681"],"checked":false,"_id":"62c7f0679ddc7a10d49dcc95","biography":"Lee Je-hoon (이제훈) is a South Korean actor.","birthday":"1984-07-04","gender":"Male","name":"Lee Je-hoon","place_of_birth":"Seoul, South Korea","tmdbID":"531736","__v":0,"createdAt":"2022-07-08T08:52:56.055Z","updatedAt":"2022-07-08T08:52:56.055Z"},{"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original//rra8c7kXwiOxwFdM3mJ83VPgFBT.jpg","knownFor":["62c9426c41395f1e04b21681"],"checked":false,"_id":"62c7f0679ddc7a10d49dcc96","biography":"Charles Robert Redford Jr. (born August 18, 1936) is an American actor, director and activist.

After one month of being a free agent, she signed an exclusive contract with Adam & Eve. She was named Penthouse Pet of the Month for September 2008. Kross' official website, ClubKayden.com, was launched on September 2, 2008. Kross has hosted a blog at UnKrossed.com, and has written regular updates and opinion columns for MikeSouth.com, an adult industry gossip blog, among other sites. Kross became exclusive to Digital Playground under a multi-year contract on January 1, 2010. Her first movie with the company, The Smiths, topped sales charts immediately and has continued to be a best seller. She was given the lead in their big budget feature, Body Heat, in her third month in contract. She won two Best Actress Awards for the role.

Clapton has been referred to as one of the most important and influential guitarists of all time. Clapton ranked fourth in Rolling Stone magazine's list of the \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\" and fourth in Gibson's Top 50 Guitarists of All Time.  In the mid sixties, Clapton left the Yardbirds to play blues with John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers. In his one-year stay with Mayall, Clapton gained the nickname \"Slowhand\", and graffiti in London declared \"Clapton is God.\" Immediately after leaving Mayall, Clapton formed with drummer Ginger Baker and bassist Jack Bruce, the power trio, Cream, in which Clapton played sustained blues improvisations and \"arty, blues-based psychedelic pop.\" For most of the seventies, Clapton's output bore the influence of the mellow style of J.J. Cale and the reggae of Bob Marley. His version of Marley's \"I Shot the Sheriff\" helped gain reggae a mass market. Two of his most popular recordings were \"Layla\", recorded by Derek and the Dominos, and Robert Johnson's \"Crossroads\", recorded by Cream. A recipient of seventeen Grammy Awards, in 2004 Clapton was awarded a CBE for services to music.

She is the recipient of various accolades including two Academy Awards, two British Academy Film Awards, seven Golden Globe Awards, a Primetime Emmy Award, the AFI Life Achievement Award, the Golden Lion Honorary Award, the Honorary Palme d'Or, and the Cecil B. DeMille Award.  Born to socialite Frances Ford Seymour and actor Henry Fonda, Fonda made her acting debut with the 1960 Broadway play There Was a Little Girl, for which she received a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play, and made her screen debut later the same year with the romantic comedy Tall Story. She rose to prominence during the 1960s with the comedies Period of Adjustment (1962), Sunday in New York (1963), Cat Ballou (1965), Barefoot in the Park (1967), and Barbarella (1968). Her first husband was Barbarella director Roger Vadim. A seven-time Academy Award nominee, she received her first nomination for They Shoot Horses, Don't They? (1969), and went on to win the Academy Award for Best Actress twice in the 1970s, for Klute (1971) and Coming Home (1978). Her other nominations were for Julia (1977), The China Syndrome (1979), On Golden Pond (1981), and The Morning After (1986). Consecutive hits Fun with Dick and Jane (1977), California Suite (1978), The Electric Horseman (1979), and 9 to 5 (1980) sustained Fonda's box-office drawing power, and she won a Primetime Emmy Award for her performance in the TV film The Dollmaker (1984). \nIn 1982, she released her first exercise video, Jane Fonda's Workout, which became the highest-selling VHS of the 20th century. It would be the first of 22 such videos over the next 13 years, which would collectively sell over 17 million copies. Divorced from her second husband Tom Hayden, she married billionaire media mogul Ted Turner in 1991 and retired from acting, following a row of commercially unsuccessful films concluded by Stanley & Iris (1990). Fonda divorced Turner in 2001 and returned to the screen with the hit Monster-in-Law (2005). Although Georgia Rule (2007) was her only other movie during the 2000s, in the early 2010s she fully re-launched her career. Subsequent films have included The Butler (2013), This Is Where I Leave You (2014), Youth (2015), Our Souls at Night (2017), and Book Club (2018).

She has also been a magazine editor and continues to be a celebrity blogger, LGBT rights activist, television producer and collaborative partner in the LGBT family vacation company R Family Vacations. \nRaised Roman Catholic, O'Donnell lost her mother to cancer as a pre-teen and has stressed the importance of protecting children and supporting families throughout her career. O'Donnell started her comedy career while still a teenager and her big break was on the talent show Star Search when she was twenty years old. A TV sitcom and a series of movies introduced her to a larger national audience and in 1996 she started hosting The Rosie O'Donnell Show which won multiple Emmy awards.\n\nDuring her years on The Rosie O'Donnell Show she wrote her first book, a memoir called Find Me and developed the nickname \"Queen Of Nice\" as well as a reputation for philanthropic efforts. She used the book's $3 million advance to establish her own For All Kids foundation and promoted other charity projects encouraging other celebrities on her show to also take part. O'Donnell came out stating \"I'm a dyke!\" two months before finishing her talk show run, saying that her primary reason was to bring attention to gay adoption issues.  O'Donnell is a foster—and adoptive—mother. She has since continued to support many LGBT causes and issues.\n\nIn 2006 O'Donnell became the new moderator on The View boosting ratings and attracting controversies with her liberal views, and strong personality, dominating many of the conversations. She became a polarizing figure to many and her strong opinions resulted in several notable controversies including an on-air dispute regarding the Bush administration's policies with the war in Iraq resulting in a mutual agreement to cancel her contract. In 2007 O'Donnell also released her second memoir, Celebrity Detox, which focuses on her struggles with fame and her time at The View. She continues to do charity work and remains involved with LGBT and family-related issues. She is best known for her inaccurate prediction that Donald Trump will never be the President of the United States. In 2008 O'Donnell starred in and executive produced America (2009 film), a Lifetime channel original movie in which she plays the therapist of the title character, a 16-year-old boy aging out of the foster care system. The film is based on the E.R. Frank book of the same name. \n\nIn October 2009, she appeared in the original cast of Love, Loss, and What I Wore.  In November 2009 \"Rosie Radio\", a daily two-hour show with O'Donnell discussing news and events on Sirius XM Radio, premiered. O'Donnell said she was approached by the company after she appeared on The Howard Stern Show.   O'Donnell has signed on with the Oprah Winfrey Network OWN to return to daytime TV with a talk show in Fall 2011. \n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Rosie O'Donnell,    .","birthday":"1962-03-21","gender":"Female","name":"Rosie O'Donnell","place_of_birth":"Commack, Long Island, New York, USA","tmdbID":"12929","__v":0,"createdAt":"2022-07-08T08:52:56.062Z","updatedAt":"2022-07-08T08:52:56.062Z"},{"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original//pem026eNKMUMnCEVXZf5T5yjH64.jpg","knownFor":["62c9426c41395f1e04b2165f"],"checked":false,"_id":"62c7f0679ddc7a10d49dccf4","biography":"  Alexander David Linz (born January 3, 1989) is an American actor who starred in several late 1990s and early 2000s films and television programs as a child actor.

He covered black artists' songs (when part of the country was segregated) and sold more copies than his black counterparts. He sold over 45 million albums, had 38 Top 40 hits and appeared in more than 12 Hollywood movies. Boone's talent as a singer and actor, combined with his old-fashioned values, contributed to his popularity in the early rock and roll era. He continues to perform, and speak as a motivational speaker, a television personality, a conservative political commentator and a preacher. \nAccording to Billboard, Boone was the second biggest charting artist of the late 1950s, behind only Elvis Presley but ahead of Ricky Nelson and The Platters, and was ranked at No. 9—behind The Rolling Stones and Paul McCartney but ahead of artists such as Aretha Franklin and The Beach Boys—in its listing of the Top 100 Top 40 Artists 1955-1995. Boone still holds the Billboard record for spending 220 consecutive weeks on the charts with more than one song.\n\nAt the age of twenty-three, he began hosting a half-hour ABC variety television series, The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom, which aired for 115 episodes (1957–1960). Many musical performers, including Edie Adams, Andy Williams, Pearl Bailey and Johnny Mathis made appearances on the show. His cover versions of rhythm and blues hits had a noticeable effect on the development of the broad popularity of rock and roll. During his tours in the 1950s, Elvis Presley was one of his opening acts.\n\nAs a prolific author, Boone had a No. 1 bestseller in the 1950s (Twixt Twelve and Twenty, Prentice-Hall). In the 1960s, he focused on gospel music and is a member of the Gospel Music Hall of Fame.\n\n ,  .","birthday":"1934-06-01","gender":"Male","name":"Pat Boone","place_of_birth":"Jacksonville, Florida, USA","tmdbID":"24810","__v":0,"createdAt":"2022-07-08T08:52:56.040Z","updatedAt":"2022-07-08T08:52:56.040Z"},{"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/null","knownFor":["62c9426c41395f1e04b216a4"],"checked":false,"_id":"62c7f0679ddc7a10d49dcc1c","biography":"","birthday":null,"gender":"Not specified","name":"Victoria Delgadillo","place_of_birth":null,"tmdbID":"2293029","__v":0,"createdAt":"2022-07-08T08:52:56.041Z","updatedAt":"2022-07-08T08:52:56.041Z"},{"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original//q8essPzbetB5NFX0KkaaQdmnMmS.jpg","knownFor":["62c9426c41395f1e04b216a3"],"checked":false,"_id":"62c7f0679ddc7a10d49dcc21","biography":"Taj Mahal is an American blues musician, a self-taught singer-songwriter and film composer who plays the guitar, piano, banjo, and harmonica, among many other instruments.","birthday":"1942-05-17","gender":"Male","name":"Taj Mahal","place_of_birth":"Harlem, New York, USA","tmdbID":"94511","__v":0,"createdAt":"2022-07-08T08:52:56.041Z","updatedAt":"2022-07-08T08:52:56.041Z"},{"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/null","knownFor":["62c9426c41395f1e04b216a3"],"checked":false,"_id":"62c7f0679ddc7a10d49dcc22","biography":"Kevin Roosevelt Moore, known as Keb' Mo', is an American blues musician and four-time Grammy Award winner.

He has been a major figure in music for five decades. Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s when he was an informal chronicler, and an apparently reluctant figurehead, of social unrest. Though he is well-known for revolutionizing perceptions of the limits of popular music in 1965 with the six-minute single \"Like a Rolling Stone,\" a number of his earlier songs such as \"Blowin' in the Wind\" and \"The Times They Are a-Changin'\" became anthems for the US civil rights and anti-war movements.  His early lyrics incorporated a variety of political, social and philosophical, as well as literary influences. They defied existing pop music conventions and appealed hugely to the then burgeoning counterculture. Initially inspired by the songs of Woody Guthrie, Robert Johnson, Hank Williams, and the performance styles of Buddy Holly and Little Richard, Dylan has both amplified and personalized musical genres, exploring numerous distinct traditions in American song—from folk, blues and country to gospel, rock and roll, and rockabilly, to English, Scottish, and Irish folk music, embracing even jazz and swing.\n\nDylan performs with guitar, keyboards, and harmonica. Backed by a changing line-up of musicians, he has toured steadily since the late 1980s on what has been dubbed the Never Ending Tour. His accomplishments as a recording artist and performer have been central to his career, but his greatest contribution is generally considered to be his songwriting.\n\nSince 1994, Dylan has published three books of drawings and paintings, and his work has been exhibited in major art galleries. As a songwriter and musician, Dylan has received numerous awards over the years including Grammy, Golden Globe, and Academy Awards; he has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame, and Songwriters Hall of Fame. In 2008, a road called the Bob Dylan Pathway was opened in the singer's honor in his birthplace of Duluth, Minnesota. The Pulitzer Prize jury in 2008 awarded him a special citation for \"his profound impact on popular music and American culture, marked by lyrical compositions of extraordinary poetic power.\"\n\n ,  ","birthday":"1941-05-24","gender":"Male","name":"Bob Dylan","place_of_birth":"Duluth, Minnesota, USA","tmdbID":"1487","__v":0,"createdAt":"2022-07-08T08:52:56.027Z","updatedAt":"2022-07-08T08:52:56.027Z"},{"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original//v2ecmsUfu2VaMcGmrZfSGm7ZZ4d.jpg","knownFor":["62c9426c41395f1e04b216b4"],"checked":false,"_id":"62c7f0679ddc7a10d49dcbd9","biography":"","birthday":null,"gender":"Female","name":"Jacqueline Breakwell","place_of_birth":null,"tmdbID":"2641481","__v":0,"createdAt":"2022-07-08T08:52:56.027Z","updatedAt":"2022-07-08T08:52:56.027Z"},{"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original//t64fHmpEQO2AN2QkVIyMyyHkEoQ.jpg","knownFor":["62c9426c41395f1e04b216b4"],"checked":false,"_id":"62c7f0679ddc7a10d49dcbda","biography":"","birthday":null,"gender":"Not specified","name":"Mike Kovac","place_of_birth":null,"tmdbID":"1101412","__v":0,"createdAt":"2022-07-08T08:52:56.028Z","updatedAt":"2022-07-08T08:52:56.028Z"},{"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original//4t8Ax6fuRsSkOsJc8A0BCeACmst.jpg","knownFor":["62c9426c41395f1e04b216b4"],"checked":false,"_id":"62c7f0679ddc7a10d49dcbdb","biography":"Chelsey Marie Reist is a Canadian actress, television host, and dancer.

Following the band's break-up, he had a successful career as a solo artist and later as part of the Traveling Wilburys, and also as a film and record producer. Harrison is listed at number 21 in Rolling Stone magazine's list of \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\".  Although most of The Beatles' songs were written by Lennon and McCartney, Beatle albums generally included one or two of Harrison's own songs, from With The Beatles onwards.  His later compositions with The Beatles include \"Here Comes the Sun\", \"Something\" and \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\". By the time of the band's break-up, Harrison had accumulated a backlog of material, which he then released as the acclaimed and successful triple album All Things Must Pass in 1970, from which came two singles: a double A-side single, \"My Sweet Lord\" backed with \"Isn't It a Pity\", and \"What Is Life\". In addition to his solo work, Harrison co-wrote two hits for Ringo Starr, another former Beatle, as well as songs for the Traveling Wilburys—the supergroup he formed in 1988 with Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, Jeff Lynne, and Roy Orbison.  Harrison embraced Indian culture and Hinduism in the mid 1960s, and helped expand Western awareness of sitar music and of the Hare Krishna movement. With Ravi Shankar he organised a major charity concert with the 1971 Concert for Bangladesh. \nBesides being a musician, he was also a record producer and co-founder of the production company HandMade Films. In his work as a film producer, he collaborated with people as diverse as the members of Monty Python and Madonna.

She started stripping for extra money. This angered her boyfriend so she then sought out an agent on-line to do pornography. Her first role was in Just Over Eighteen 10 from Red Light District Video. She performed in 70 pornographic film scenes over the next eight months, many of which included anal scenes. In late-2004, she signed an exclusive, three-year contract with porn production studio Digital Playground. Presley claims she first became involved in pornography as revenge against her ex-boyfriend.

Teagan Presley left Digital Playground to start her own web site and production company with her husband, adult performer Tyler Durden (AKA Tyler Wood). She complained that Digital Playground was not allowing her to perform for her new company. However, Digital Playground refuted the complaint and said that Teagan was free to work as lawyers were resolving her contract status. While there were reports that her surname \"Presley\" was owned by the studio Digital Playground, a representative of the studio has denied those reports as false.In October 2008, she was invited by Digital Playground to host the red carpet at the premiere of Pirates II: Stagnetti's Revenge, a film produced by the firm. She is also seen on the cover of Temptress magazine in the unrated version of the movie Superbad. Teagan was also interviewed by Bush League TV for their short internet video \"Bush League 101: How to Break Into the Porn Business.\" In July 2008, she announced that she had her breast implants replaced and that she would be auctioning them on eBay, with 20% of the proceeds going to Susan G. Komen for the Cure; she also announced that she would stop performing boy/girl sex scenes. The remainder of the proceeds were to be used to fund her divorce and custody cases. \nIn September 2008, in partnership with Rock Star Diversified Entertainment and St Louis Missouri based WAZUPSTL Web Promotions &amp; Design, Presley helped create the first Blu-ray-centric adult review site AdultBluReview.com, where Teagan herself and other adult starlets review adult Blu-ray titles.

After signing with major label DGC Records, the band found breakthrough success with \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" from its second album Nevermind (1991). Following the success of Nevermind, Nirvana was labeled \"the flagship band\" of Generation X, and Cobain hailed as \"the spokesman of a generation\". Cobain however was often uncomfortable and frustrated, believing his message and artistic vision to have been misinterpreted by the public, with his personal issues often subject to media attention. He challenged Nirvana's audience with its final studio album In Utero (1993). \nDuring the last years of his life, Cobain struggled with heroin addiction, illness and depression, his fame and public image, as well as the professional and lifelong personal pressures surrounding himself and his wife, musician Courtney Love. On April 8, 1994, Cobain was found dead at his home in Seattle, the victim of what was officially ruled a suicide by a self-inflicted shotgun wound to the head.

He began his career as a stage actor during the 1980s, obtaining supporting roles in film and television. Spacey's first roles in film were in Mike Nichols' Heartburn (1986), and Working Girl (1988). He gained critical acclaim in the 1990s, with an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for the neo-noir crime thriller The Usual Suspects (1995) and an Academy Award for Best Actor for the midlife-crisis-themed drama American Beauty (1999). His other starring roles have included Glengarry Glen Ross (1992), the comedy-drama film Swimming with Sharks (1994), the psychological thriller Seven (1995), the neo-noir crime film L.A. Confidential (1997), the drama Pay It Forward (2000), the science fiction-mystery film K-PAX (2001), the musical biopic Beyond the Sea (2004), the superhero film Superman Returns (2006), and the action film Baby Driver (2017).  In Broadway theatre, Spacey starred in Long Day's Journey into Night in 1986 alongside Jack Lemmon. In 1991, he won a Tony Award for his role in Lost in Yonkers. He continued to act in theatre receiving his second Tony Award nomination for The Iceman Cometh in 1999. He was the artistic director of the Old Vic theatre in London from 2004 until stepping down in mid-2015. In 2017, he hosted the 71st Tony Awards. From 2013 to 2017, Spacey played Frank Underwood in the Netflix political drama series House of Cards, which won him a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Drama and two consecutive Screen Actors Guild Awards for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series as well as five consecutive Primetime Emmy Award nominations for Best Actor in a Drama Series. \nIn October 2017, actor Anthony Rapp accused Spacey of making a sexual advance toward him in 1986, when Rapp was 14. Other men alleged that Spacey had made unwanted advances and had sexually harassed and assaulted them as well. Netflix cut ties with Spacey, shelving his film Gore and removing him from the last season of House of Cards. His role as J. Paul Getty in Ridley Scott's film All the Money in the World (2017) was reshot with Christopher Plummer in his place. Spacey appeared in the 2018 film Billionaire Boys Club (which had been completed before the allegations surfaced), which was released with his role unchanged.\n\n ,  .","birthday":"1959-07-26","gender":"Male","name":"Kevin Spacey","place_of_birth":"South Orange, New Jersey, USA","tmdbID":"1979","__v":0,"createdAt":"2022-07-08T08:52:56.060Z","updatedAt":"2022-07-08T08:52:56.060Z"},{"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original//h9w9pQbiderRWAC2mi7spjzuIGz.jpg","knownFor":["62c9426c41395f1e04b21666"],"checked":false,"_id":"62c7f0679ddc7a10d49dcce6","biography":"Phyllis Smith (born July 10, 1951) is an American film and television actress who is best known for playing Phyllis Lapin-Vance on The Office.   ,  .","birthday":"1951-07-10","gender":"Female","name":"Phyllis Smith","place_of_birth":"Lemay, Missouri, USA","tmdbID":"169200","__v":0,"createdAt":"2022-07-08T08:52:56.061Z","updatedAt":"2022-07-08T08:52:56.061Z"},{"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original//nJo91Czesn6z0d0pkfbDoVZY3sg.jpg","knownFor":["62c9426c41395f1e04b21665"],"checked":false,"_id":"62c7f0679ddc7a10d49dcce8","biography":"Alfred Molina (born 24 May 1953) is an English-American actor.

She was nominated by President Bill Clinton, replacing retiring justice Byron White, and at the time was generally viewed as a moderate consensus-builder. She eventually became part of the liberal wing of the Court as the Court shifted to the right over time. Ginsburg was the first Jewish woman and the second woman to serve on the Court, after Sandra Day O'Connor.  Ginsburg was born and grew up in Brooklyn, New York. Her older sister died when she was a baby, and her mother died shortly before Ginsburg graduated from high school. She earned her bachelor's degree at Cornell University and married Martin D. Ginsburg, becoming a mother before starting law school at Harvard, where she was one of the few women in her class. Ginsburg transferred to Columbia Law School, where she graduated joint first in her class. During the early 1960s, she worked with the Columbia Law School Project on International Procedure, learned Swedish, and co-authored a book with Swedish jurist Anders Bruzelius; her work in Sweden profoundly influenced her thinking on gender equality. She then became a professor at Rutgers Law School and Columbia Law School, teaching civil procedure as one of the few women in her field.  Ginsburg spent much of her legal career as an advocate for gender equality and women's rights, winning many arguments before the Supreme Court. She advocated as a volunteer attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union and was a member of its board of directors and one of its general counsel in the 1970s. In 1980, President Jimmy Carter appointed her to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, where she served until her appointment to the Supreme Court in 1993. Between O'Connor's retirement in 2006 and the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor in 2009, she was the only female justice on the Supreme Court. During that time, Ginsburg became more forceful with her dissents, notably in Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. (2007). Ginsburg's dissenting opinion was credited with inspiring the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act which was signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2009, making it easier for employees to win pay discrimination claims. \nGinsburg received attention in American popular culture for her passionate dissents in numerous cases, widely seen as reflecting paradigmatically liberal views of the law.

Ginsburg died at her home in Washington, D.C., on September 18, 2020, at the age of 87, from complications of metastatic pancreatic cancer.

Born in Bay City, Michigan, she moved to New York City in 1977 to pursue a career in modern dance. After performing in the music groups Breakfast Club and Emmy, she released her debut album in 1983. She followed it with a series of albums in which she found immense popularity by pushing the boundaries of lyrical content in mainstream popular music and imagery in her music videos, which became a fixture on MTV. Throughout her career, many of her songs have hit number one on the record charts, including \"Like a Virgin\", \"Papa Don't Preach\", \"Like a Prayer\", \"Vogue\", \"Frozen\", \"Music\", \"Hung Up\", and \"4 Minutes\". Critics have praised Madonna for her diverse musical productions while at the same time serving as a lightning rod for religious controversy.  Her career was further enhanced by film appearances that began in 1979, despite mixed commentary. She won critical acclaim and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for her role in Evita (1996), but has received harsh feedback for other film roles. Madonna's other ventures include being a fashion designer, children's book author, film director and producer. She has been acclaimed as a businesswoman, and in 2007, she signed an unprecedented US $120 million contract with Live Nation. \nMadonna has sold more than 300 million records worldwide and is recognized as the world's top-selling female recording artist of all time by the Guinness World Records. According to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), she is the best-selling female rock artist of the 20th century and the second top-selling female artist in the United States, behind Barbra Streisand, with 64 million certified albums. In 2008, Billboard magazine ranked Madonna at number two, behind only The Beatles, on the Billboard Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists, making her the most successful solo artist in the history of the Billboard chart. She was also inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in the same year. Considered to be one of the \"25 Most Powerful Women of the Past Century\" by Time for being an influential figure in contemporary music, Madonna is known for continuously reinventing both her music and image, and for retaining a standard of autonomy within the recording industry.","birthday":"1958-08-16","gender":"Female","name":"Madonna","place_of_birth":"Bay City, Michigan, USA","tmdbID":"3125","__v":0,"createdAt":"2022-07-08T08:52:56.051Z","updatedAt":"2022-07-08T08:52:56.051Z"},{"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original//usWnHCzbADijULREZYSJ0qfM00y.jpg","knownFor":[],"checked":false,"_id":"62c7f0679ddc7a10d49dcc7c","biography":"Milla Jovovich (born December 17, 1975) is an Ukrainian-born American actress, supermodel, musician, and fashion designer.

At the age of six, he was hired to perform riding and lariat tricks in the rodeo owned by western star Hoot Gibson. Gibson convinced young Jones and his parents that there was a place for him in Hollywood, and the boy and his mother went west. Gibson arranged for some small parts for the boy, whose good looks, energy, and pleasant voice quickly landed him more and bigger parts, both in low-budget Westerns and in more substantial productions. In 1940, he had one of his most prominent (although invisible) roles, as the voice of Pinocchio (1940) in Walt Disney's animated film of the same name. Jones attended Hollywood High School and, at 15, took over the role of Henry Aldrich on the hit radio show \"The Aldrich Family.\" He learned carpentry and augmented his income with jobs in that field. He served in the Army in Alaska during the final months of World War II. Gene Autry, who before the war had cast Jones in several Westerns, put him back to work in films and particularly in television, on programs produced by Autry's company.

Known for both her comedic and dramatic roles, she has been featured three times in annual rankings of the world's highest-paid actresses. She has received various accolades, including two Golden Globe Awards, in addition to nominations for six Academy Awards and seven British Academy Film Awards.  Born in Vicenza, Italy to American parents and raised in Castle Rock, Colorado, Adams trained to be a ballerina but found musical theater a better fit at the age of 18. From 1994 to 1998, she worked in dinner theater, and made her feature film debut with a supporting part in the dark comedy film Drop Dead Gorgeous (1999). After moving to Los Angeles, she made guest appearances in television and took on \"mean girl\" parts in low-budget feature films. Her first major role came in Steven Spielberg's biopic Catch Me If You Can (2002), but she was unemployed for a year afterward. Her breakthrough came when she portrayed a loquacious pregnant woman in the independent comedy-drama film Junebug (2005), for which she received her first Academy Award nomination. \nThe musical fantasy film Enchanted (2007), in which Adams played a cheerful fairy tale princess-type character, was her first major success as a leading lady. She followed this by playing naïve, optimistic women in films like the drama Doubt (2008), and subsequently played stronger parts to positive reviews in the sports film The Fighter (2010) and the psychological drama film The Master (2012). In 2013, she began portraying Lois Lane in superhero films set in the DC Extended Universe. She won two consecutive Golden Globe Awards for Best Actress for playing a seductive con artist in the crime film American Hustle (2013) and the painter Margaret Keane in the biopic film Big Eyes (2014).

In a career spanning nine decades and continuing until shortly before his death, he appeared in more than 300 films and was among the last surviving stars of the silent film era. \nAt the height of a career that was marked by declines and comebacks, Rooney performed the role of Andy Hardy in a series of 16 films in the 1930s and 1940s that epitomized American family values. A versatile performer, he became a celebrated character actor later in his career. Laurence Olivier once said he considered Rooney \"the best there has ever been\". Clarence Brown, who directed him in two of his earliest dramatic roles, National Velvet and The Human Comedy, said he was \"the closest thing to a genius I ever worked with\".\n\nRooney first performed in vaudeville as a child and made his film debut at the age of six. At 14, he played Puck in the play and later the 1935 film adaptation of A Midsummer Night's Dream. Critic David Thomson hailed his performance as \"one of the cinema's most arresting pieces of magic\". In 1938, he co-starred in Boys Town. At 19, he was the first teenager to be nominated for an Oscar for his leading role in Babes in Arms, and he was awarded a special Academy Juvenile Award in 1939. At the peak of his career between the ages of 15 and 25, he made 43 films, which made him one of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's most consistently successful actors and a favorite of MGM studio head Louis B. Mayer.\n\nRooney was the top box-office attraction from 1939 to 1941 and one of the best-paid actors of that era, but his career would never again rise to such heights. Drafted into the Army during World War II, he served nearly two years entertaining over two million troops on stage and radio and was awarded a Bronze Star for performing in combat zones. Returning from the war in 1945, he was too old for juvenile roles but too short to be an adult movie star, and was unable to get as many starring roles. Nevertheless, Rooney's popularity was renewed with well-received supporting roles in films such as Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961), Requiem for a Heavyweight (1962), It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World (1963), and The Black Stallion (1979). In the early 1980s, he returned to Broadway in Sugar Babies and again became a celebrated star. Rooney made hundreds of appearances on TV, including dramas, variety programs, and talk shows, and won an Emmy in 1982 plus a Golden Globe for his role in Bill (1981).","birthday":"1920-09-23","gender":"Male","name":"Mickey Rooney","place_of_birth":"Brooklyn, New York City, New York, USA","tmdbID":"1937","__v":0,"createdAt":"2022-07-08T08:52:56.094Z","updatedAt":"2022-07-08T08:52:56.094Z"},{"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original//bBA5xY4wrOUIpGnY6QPPQ9vNJB1.jpg","knownFor":["62c9426c41395f1e04b215fc"],"checked":false,"_id":"62c7f0679ddc7a10d49dce0d","biography":"Sumi Shimamoto is a Japanese voice actress.","birthday":"1954-12-08","gender":"Female","name":"Sumi Shimamoto","place_of_birth":"Kōchi, Japan","tmdbID":"613","__v":0,"createdAt":"2022-07-08T08:52:56.096Z","updatedAt":"2022-07-08T08:52:56.096Z"},{"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original//95f7jVXUwkHUUfj3AjvTJYx3pei.jpg","knownFor":["62c9426c41395f1e04b215f9"],"checked":false,"_id":"62c7f0679ddc7a10d49dce19","biography":"Jesse McCartney (born April 10, 1987) is an American singer-songwriter and voice actor.

At a young age Hoffman knew he wanted to study in the arts, and entered into the Los Angeles Conservatory of Music; later he decided to go into acting, for which he trained at the Pasadena Playhouse in Los Angeles. His first theatrical performance was 1961's A Cook for Mr. General as Ridzinski. During that time he appeared in several guest roles on television shows like Naked City and The Defenders. He then starred in the 1966 off-Broadway play Eh? where his performance garnered him both a Theatre World Award and Drama Desk Award.  His breakthrough role was as Benjamin Braddock in Mike Nichols' critically acclaimed and iconic film The Graduate (1967), for which he received his first Academy Award nomination. His next role was \"Ratso\" Rizzo in John Schlesinger's Midnight Cowboy (1969), in which he acted alongside Jon Voight; they both received Oscar nominations, and the film went on to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. He gained success in the 1970s playing roles that shaped the craft of his acting, crossing genres effortlessly in the western Little Big Man (1970), the prison drama Papillon (1973), playing a controversial and groundbreaking comedian in Bob Fosse's Lenny (1975), Marathon Man alongside Laurence Olivier (1976), and as Carl Bernstein investigating the Watergate scandal in All the President's Men (1976). In 1979, Hoffman starred in the family drama Kramer vs. Kramer alongside Meryl Streep.

Ed Wynn first appeared on television on July 7, 1936 in a brief, ad-libbed spot with Graham McNamee during an NBC experimental television broadcast. In the 1949–50 season, Ed Wynn hosted one of the first network, comedy-variety television shows, on CBS, and won both a Peabody Award and an Emmy Award in 1949. Buster Keaton, Lucille Ball, and The Three Stooges all made guest appearances with Wynn. This was the first CBS variety television show to originate from Los Angeles, which was seen live on the west coast, but filmed via kinescope for distribution in the Midwest and East, as the national coaxial cable had yet to be completed. Wynn was also a rotating host of NBC's Four Star Revue from 1950 through 1952. \nAfter the end of Wynn's third television series, The Ed Wynn Show (a short-lived situation comedy on NBC's 1958–59 schedule), his son, actor Keenan Wynn, encouraged him to make a career change rather than retire. The comedian reluctantly began a career as a dramatic actor in television and movies. Father and son appeared in three productions, the first of which was the 1956 Playhouse 90 broadcast of Rod Serling's play Requiem for a Heavyweight. Ed was terrified of straight acting and kept goofing his lines in rehearsal. When the producers wanted to fire him, star Jack Palance said he would quit if they fired Ed. (However, unbeknownst to Wynn, supporting player Ned Glass was his secret understudy in case something did happen before air time.) On live broadcast night, Wynn surprised everyone with his pitch-perfect performance, and his quick ad libs to cover his mistakes. A dramatization of what happened during the production was later staged as an April 1960 Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse episode, \"The Man in the Funny Suit\", starring both senior and junior Wynns, with key figures involved in the original production also portraying themselves. Ed and his son also worked together in the Jose Ferrer film The Great Man, with Ed again proving his unexpected skills in drama.\n\nRequiem established Wynn as a serious dramatic actor who could easily hold his own with the best. His role in The Diary of Anne Frank (1959) won him an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor.\n\nAlso in 1959, Wynn appeared on Serling's TV series The Twilight Zone in \"One for the Angels\". Serling, a longtime admirer, had written that episode especially for him, and Wynn later in 1963 starred in the episode \"Ninety Years Without Slumbering\". For the rest of his life, Wynn skillfully moved between comic and dramatic roles. He appeared in feature films and anthology television, endearing himself to new generations of fans.","birthday":"1886-11-09","gender":"Male","name":"Ed Wynn","place_of_birth":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA ","tmdbID":"5833","__v":0,"createdAt":"2022-07-08T08:52:56.074Z","updatedAt":"2022-07-08T08:52:56.074Z"},{"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original//xjg0ZIxP0tFcEQCTeRgKxNtLdpe.jpg","knownFor":["62c9426c41395f1e04b2164c","62c9426c41395f1e04b2163b"],"checked":false,"_id":"62c7f0679ddc7a10d49dcd46","biography":"Clarence John Brown III (born January 5, 1959) is an American film, television and voice actor.

Known for her idiosyncratic personality and fashion style, she has received various accolades throughout her career spanning over six decades, including an Academy Award, a British Academy Film Award, two Golden Globe Awards, and the AFI Life Achievement Award.  Keaton began her career on stage appearing in the original 1968 Broadway production of the musical Hair. The next year, she received a Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play nomination for her performance in Woody Allen's comic play Play it Again, Sam. She then made her screen debut in a small role in Lovers and Other Strangers (1970). She rose to prominence with her first major film role as Kay Adams-Corleone in Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather (1972), a role she reprised in its sequels The Godfather Part II (1974) and The Godfather Part III (1990). The films that most shaped her career were those with director and co-star Woody Allen, beginning with the film adaptation of Play It Again, Sam (1972). Her next two films with Allen, Sleeper (1973) and Love and Death (1975), established her as a comic actor. Her fourth, the romantic comedy Annie Hall (1977), won her the Academy Award for Best Actress. \nTo avoid being typecast as her Annie Hall persona, Keaton appeared in several dramatic films, starring in Looking for Mr. Goodbar (1977) and Allen's Interiors (1978), and received three more Academy Award nominations for playing feminist activist Louise Bryant in Reds (1981), a woman with leukemia in Marvin's Room (1996), and a dramatist in Something's Gotta Give (2003).

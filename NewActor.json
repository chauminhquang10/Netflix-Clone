He has been a major figure in music for five decades. Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s when he was an informal chronicler, and an apparently reluctant figurehead, of social unrest. Though he is well-known for revolutionizing perceptions of the limits of popular music in 1965 with the six-minute single \"Like a Rolling Stone,\" a number of his earlier songs such as \"Blowin' in the Wind\" and \"The Times They Are a-Changin'\" became anthems for the US civil rights and anti-war movements.  His early lyrics incorporated a variety of political, social and philosophical, as well as literary influences. They defied existing pop music conventions and appealed hugely to the then burgeoning counterculture. Initially inspired by the songs of Woody Guthrie, Robert Johnson, Hank Williams, and the performance styles of Buddy Holly and Little Richard, Dylan has both amplified and personalized musical genres, exploring numerous distinct traditions in American song—from folk, blues and country to gospel, rock and roll, and rockabilly, to English, Scottish, and Irish folk music, embracing even jazz and swing.\n\nDylan performs with guitar, keyboards, and harmonica. Backed by a changing line-up of musicians, he has toured steadily since the late 1980s on what has been dubbed the Never Ending Tour. His accomplishments as a recording artist and performer have been central to his career, but his greatest contribution is generally considered to be his songwriting.\n\nSince 1994, Dylan has published three books of drawings and paintings, and his work has been exhibited in major art galleries. As a songwriter and musician, Dylan has received numerous awards over the years including Grammy, Golden Globe, and Academy Awards; he has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame, and Songwriters Hall of Fame. In 2008, a road called the Bob Dylan Pathway was opened in the singer's honor in his birthplace of Duluth, Minnesota. The Pulitzer Prize jury in 2008 awarded him a special citation for \"his profound impact on popular music and American culture, marked by lyrical compositions of extraordinary poetic power.\"\n\n ,  ","birthday":"1941-05-24","gender":"Male","name":"Bob Dylan","place_of_birth":"Duluth, Minnesota, USA","tmdbID":1487,"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original//ubCLNwXh9Nv3EHkOkdeVbXMZa5P.jpg"},{"biography":"","birthday":null,"gender":"Female","name":"Jacqueline Breakwell","place_of_birth":null,"tmdbID":2641481,"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original//v2ecmsUfu2VaMcGmrZfSGm7ZZ4d.jpg"},{"biography":"","birthday":null,"gender":"Not specified","name":"Mike Kovac","place_of_birth":null,"tmdbID":1101412,"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original//t64fHmpEQO2AN2QkVIyMyyHkEoQ.jpg"},{"biography":"Chelsey Marie Reist is a Canadian actress, television host, and dancer.

She was nominated by President Bill Clinton, replacing retiring justice Byron White, and at the time was generally viewed as a moderate consensus-builder. She eventually became part of the liberal wing of the Court as the Court shifted to the right over time. Ginsburg was the first Jewish woman and the second woman to serve on the Court, after Sandra Day O'Connor.  Ginsburg was born and grew up in Brooklyn, New York. Her older sister died when she was a baby, and her mother died shortly before Ginsburg graduated from high school. She earned her bachelor's degree at Cornell University and married Martin D. Ginsburg, becoming a mother before starting law school at Harvard, where she was one of the few women in her class. Ginsburg transferred to Columbia Law School, where she graduated joint first in her class. During the early 1960s, she worked with the Columbia Law School Project on International Procedure, learned Swedish, and co-authored a book with Swedish jurist Anders Bruzelius; her work in Sweden profoundly influenced her thinking on gender equality. She then became a professor at Rutgers Law School and Columbia Law School, teaching civil procedure as one of the few women in her field.  Ginsburg spent much of her legal career as an advocate for gender equality and women's rights, winning many arguments before the Supreme Court. She advocated as a volunteer attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union and was a member of its board of directors and one of its general counsel in the 1970s. In 1980, President Jimmy Carter appointed her to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, where she served until her appointment to the Supreme Court in 1993. Between O'Connor's retirement in 2006 and the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor in 2009, she was the only female justice on the Supreme Court. During that time, Ginsburg became more forceful with her dissents, notably in Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. (2007). Ginsburg's dissenting opinion was credited with inspiring the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act which was signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2009, making it easier for employees to win pay discrimination claims. \nGinsburg received attention in American popular culture for her passionate dissents in numerous cases, widely seen as reflecting paradigmatically liberal views of the law. She was dubbed \"The Notorious R.B.G.\", and she later embraced the moniker. Ginsburg died at her home in Washington, D.C., on September 18, 2020, at the age of 87, from complications of metastatic pancreatic cancer. Given the proximity of her death to the 2020 election and Ginsburg's wish for her replacement not to be chosen \"until a new president is installed\", the decision for President Trump to appoint and all but one of the Republican Senators to confirm Amy Coney Barrett as her replacement proved controversial after the Senate Republican majority's prior refusal to hold a hearing or vote for Merrick Garland in early 2016 under Barack Obama after the death of Antonin Scalia.","birthday":"1933-03-15","gender":"Female","name":"Ruth Bader Ginsburg","place_of_birth":"Brooklyn, New York, USA","tmdbID":1493224,"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original//oYQwgl6zgEYVIPEZSfmDlntJGYv.jpg"},{"biography":"","birthday":null,"gender":"Not specified","name":"Paris Dupree","place_of_birth":null,"tmdbID":2497475,"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/null"},{"biography":"","birthday":null,"gender":"Not specified","name":"Dorian Corey","place_of_birth":null,"tmdbID":107840,"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/null"},{"biography":"","birthday":null,"gender":"Not specified","name":"Andre Christian","place_of_birth":null,"tmdbID":2497474,"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/null"},{"biography":"","birthday":null,"gender":"Not specified","name":"Brooke Xtravaganza","place_of_birth":null,"tmdbID":2497495,"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/null"},{"biography":"","birthday":null,"gender":"Not specified","name":"Carmen Xtravaganza","place_of_birth":null,"tmdbID":2497494,"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/null"},{"biography":"","birthday":null,"gender":"Male","name":"Michael Gingold","place_of_birth":null,"tmdbID":99994,"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/null"},{"biography":"Kier-La Janisse (1972-) is a Canadian film writer, programmer and producer, founder of international horror school The Miskatonic Institute of Horror Studies and author of A Violent Professional: The Films of Luciano Rossi (FAB Press, 2007) and House of Psychotic Women: An Autobiographical Topography of Female Neurosis in Horror and Exploitation Films (FAB Press, 2012).

He covered black artists' songs (when part of the country was segregated) and sold more copies than his black counterparts. He sold over 45 million albums, had 38 Top 40 hits and appeared in more than 12 Hollywood movies. Boone's talent as a singer and actor, combined with his old-fashioned values, contributed to his popularity in the early rock and roll era. He continues to perform, and speak as a motivational speaker, a television personality, a conservative political commentator and a preacher. \nAccording to Billboard, Boone was the second biggest charting artist of the late 1950s, behind only Elvis Presley but ahead of Ricky Nelson and The Platters, and was ranked at No. 9—behind The Rolling Stones and Paul McCartney but ahead of artists such as Aretha Franklin and The Beach Boys—in its listing of the Top 100 Top 40 Artists 1955-1995. Boone still holds the Billboard record for spending 220 consecutive weeks on the charts with more than one song.\n\nAt the age of twenty-three, he began hosting a half-hour ABC variety television series, The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom, which aired for 115 episodes (1957–1960). Many musical performers, including Edie Adams, Andy Williams, Pearl Bailey and Johnny Mathis made appearances on the show.

Following the band's break-up, he had a successful career as a solo artist and later as part of the Traveling Wilburys, and also as a film and record producer. Harrison is listed at number 21 in Rolling Stone magazine's list of \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\".  Although most of The Beatles' songs were written by Lennon and McCartney, Beatle albums generally included one or two of Harrison's own songs, from With The Beatles onwards.  His later compositions with The Beatles include \"Here Comes the Sun\", \"Something\" and \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\". By the time of the band's break-up, Harrison had accumulated a backlog of material, which he then released as the acclaimed and successful triple album All Things Must Pass in 1970, from which came two singles: a double A-side single, \"My Sweet Lord\" backed with \"Isn't It a Pity\", and \"What Is Life\". In addition to his solo work, Harrison co-wrote two hits for Ringo Starr, another former Beatle, as well as songs for the Traveling Wilburys—the supergroup he formed in 1988 with Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, Jeff Lynne, and Roy Orbison.  Harrison embraced Indian culture and Hinduism in the mid 1960s, and helped expand Western awareness of sitar music and of the Hare Krishna movement. With Ravi Shankar he organised a major charity concert with the 1971 Concert for Bangladesh. \nBesides being a musician, he was also a record producer and co-founder of the production company HandMade Films. In his work as a film producer, he collaborated with people as diverse as the members of Monty Python and Madonna.  He was married twice, to model Pattie Boyd from 1966 to 1974, and for 23 years to record company secretary Olivia Trinidad Arias, with whom he had one son, Dhani Harrison. He was a close friend of Eric Clapton. He is the only Beatle to have published an autobiography, with I Me Mine in 1980. Harrison died of lung cancer in 2001.","birthday":"1943-02-25","gender":"Male","name":"George Harrison","place_of_birth":"Liverpool, England, UK","tmdbID":10593,"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original//zwUO2gnKBnSrKOB9hnhI9GdOX6e.jpg"},{"biography":"","birthday":null,"gender":"Not specified","name":"Miguel Ángel Hidalgo","place_of_birth":null,"tmdbID":2293030,"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/null"},{"biography":"","birthday":null,"gender":"Not specified","name":"Victoria Delgadillo","place_of_birth":null,"tmdbID":2293029,"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/null"},{"biography":"","birthday":null,"gender":"Not specified","name":"José Pelaes","place_of_birth":null,"tmdbID":2293027,"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/null"},{"biography":"","birthday":null,"gender":"Not specified","name":"Vianney Trejo","place_of_birth":null,"tmdbID":2293017,"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/null"},{"biography":"Eric Patrick Clapton, CBE (born 30 March 1945) is an English guitarist, vocalist, and songwriter.

Clapton has been referred to as one of the most important and influential guitarists of all time. Clapton ranked fourth in Rolling Stone magazine's list of the \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\" and fourth in Gibson's Top 50 Guitarists of All Time.  In the mid sixties, Clapton left the Yardbirds to play blues with John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers. In his one-year stay with Mayall, Clapton gained the nickname \"Slowhand\", and graffiti in London declared \"Clapton is God.\" Immediately after leaving Mayall, Clapton formed with drummer Ginger Baker and bassist Jack Bruce, the power trio, Cream, in which Clapton played sustained blues improvisations and \"arty, blues-based psychedelic pop.\" For most of the seventies, Clapton's output bore the influence of the mellow style of J.J. Cale and the reggae of Bob Marley. His version of Marley's \"I Shot the Sheriff\" helped gain reggae a mass market. Two of his most popular recordings were \"Layla\", recorded by Derek and the Dominos, and Robert Johnson's \"Crossroads\", recorded by Cream.

She has appeared on the cover of more than a hundred magazines, and has also starred in films such as The Fifth Element (1997), Ultraviolet (2006), and the 'Resident Evil' franchise.

Following more small television appearances such as the \"Fair Exchange\" (1989) and a 1989 role as a French girl (she was 14 at the time then) on a Married with Children episode and film roles, she gained notoriety with the romance film Return to the Blue Lagoon (1991). She appeared in 1993's Dazed and Confused alongside Ben Affleck and Matthew McConaughey.

After signing with major label DGC Records, the band found breakthrough success with \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" from its second album Nevermind (1991). Following the success of Nevermind, Nirvana was labeled \"the flagship band\" of Generation X, and Cobain hailed as \"the spokesman of a generation\". Cobain however was often uncomfortable and frustrated, believing his message and artistic vision to have been misinterpreted by the public, with his personal issues often subject to media attention. He challenged Nirvana's audience with its final studio album In Utero (1993). \nDuring the last years of his life, Cobain struggled with heroin addiction, illness and depression, his fame and public image, as well as the professional and lifelong personal pressures surrounding himself and his wife, musician Courtney Love. On April 8, 1994, Cobain was found dead at his home in Seattle, the victim of what was officially ruled a suicide by a self-inflicted shotgun wound to the head.

The blond-maned, blue-eyed comedian with the sad, droopy mustache first came in contact with the arts by honing in on his innate talents as a painter. In order to pay his art school tuition, he started organizing bands. At around the same time, he discovered that stand-up comedy was another way to allow his creative juices to flow.  Martin's early recognition as a humorist led to a recording contract, and, over the years, he would be Grammy-nominated several times for a number of eccentric comedy albums. His gimmick and allure came in the form of a dry, humorless delivery and a bland, highly conservative-looking demeanor, which masked a sly, witty and ultra-hip philosophy. \nGaining popularity in the 1970s, he finally broke into TV with the cult soap opera parody \"Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman\" (1976) in which he played Garth Gimble, a volatile wife abuser whose comeuppance occurred in the form of an aluminum Christmas tree (impaled) in his home closet. Martin was so popular on the show that he was resurrected in the spin-off series \"Fernwood 2 Night\" (1977) as twin brother Barth Gimble, who was a co-host of the town's television program along with Fred Willard's Jerry Hubbard character.\n\nAfter this peak, Martin became a sought-after guest on the talk show circuit, not to mention variety specials and TV movies. He tried his hand at producing and starring in his own sitcom \"Domestic Life\" (1984) but the series failed. He also added his special brand of merriment to films over the years, some of them being decent, such as FM (1978), Serial (1980), Mr. Mom (1983) and Clue (1985) in the role of the tweedy-looking Colonel Mustard, while most have been either formula schtick or just plain drivel, as in Take This Job and Shove It (1981), Rented Lips (1988), which he produced and wrote, Cutting Class (1989), Far Out Man (1990) with Cheech & Chong, and Mr. Write (1994).\n\nMartin's first passion has always been art and the distinguished multi-media artist's work has been showcased in galleries throughout the world. He also authored the book \"Painting, Drawing and World,\" which is a compilation of ten years of his work. Mull is married to a composer and musician, Wendy, and they have a daughter. - IMDb Mini Biography By: Gary Brumburgh","birthday":"1943-08-18","gender":"Male","name":"Martin Mull","place_of_birth":"Chicago, Illinois, USA","tmdbID":80742,"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original//wthyliVHLrgvKUIRI1WXfEw9pjL.jpg"},{"biography":"Penn Jillette is an American magician, juggler, comedian, musician, inventor, actor, and best-selling author known for his work with fellow magician Teller as half of the team Penn & Teller.","birthday":"1955-03-05","gender":"Male","name":"Penn Jillette","place_of_birth":"Greenfield, Massachusetts, USA","tmdbID":37221,"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original//zmAaXUdx12NRsssgHbk1T31j2x9.jpg"},{"biography":"","birthday":null,"gender":"Not specified","name":"Tim Jenison","place_of_birth":null,"tmdbID":1204262,"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/null"},{"biography":"Lee Je-hoon (이제훈) is a South Korean actor.","birthday":"1984-07-04","gender":"Male","name":"Lee Je-hoon","place_of_birth":"Seoul, South Korea","tmdbID":531736,"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original//pSC05Cm8h8XEK6CS6Ak3qULbHfR.jpg"},{"biography":"Charles Robert Redford Jr. (born August 18, 1936) is an American actor, director and activist.

She has also been a magazine editor and continues to be a celebrity blogger, LGBT rights activist, television producer and collaborative partner in the LGBT family vacation company R Family Vacations. \nRaised Roman Catholic, O'Donnell lost her mother to cancer as a pre-teen and has stressed the importance of protecting children and supporting families throughout her career. O'Donnell started her comedy career while still a teenager and her big break was on the talent show Star Search when she was twenty years old. A TV sitcom and a series of movies introduced her to a larger national audience and in 1996 she started hosting The Rosie O'Donnell Show which won multiple Emmy awards.\n\nDuring her years on The Rosie O'Donnell Show she wrote her first book, a memoir called Find Me and developed the nickname \"Queen Of Nice\" as well as a reputation for philanthropic efforts. She used the book's $3 million advance to establish her own For All Kids foundation and promoted other charity projects encouraging other celebrities on her show to also take part. O'Donnell came out stating \"I'm a dyke!\" two months before finishing her talk show run, saying that her primary reason was to bring attention to gay adoption issues.  O'Donnell is a foster—and adoptive—mother. She has since continued to support many LGBT causes and issues.\n\nIn 2006 O'Donnell became the new moderator on The View boosting ratings and attracting controversies with her liberal views, and strong personality, dominating many of the conversations. She became a polarizing figure to many and her strong opinions resulted in several notable controversies including an on-air dispute regarding the Bush administration's policies with the war in Iraq resulting in a mutual agreement to cancel her contract. In 2007 O'Donnell also released her second memoir, Celebrity Detox, which focuses on her struggles with fame and her time at The View. She continues to do charity work and remains involved with LGBT and family-related issues. She is best known for her inaccurate prediction that Donald Trump will never be the President of the United States.

The line was believed to be named for violin virtuoso Yehudi Menuhin, and the search for Yehudi became a running gag on the Hope show.\n\nColonna featured in three of the popular Hope-Crosby Road films: Road to Singapore (1940) as Achilles Bombassa, Road to Rio (1947) as a Cavalry captain and The Road to Hong Kong (1962) in a cameo role. He can also be seen in the Fred Allen vehicle, It's in the Bag!

Ed Wynn first appeared on television on July 7, 1936 in a brief, ad-libbed spot with Graham McNamee during an NBC experimental television broadcast. In the 1949–50 season, Ed Wynn hosted one of the first network, comedy-variety television shows, on CBS, and won both a Peabody Award and an Emmy Award in 1949. Buster Keaton, Lucille Ball, and The Three Stooges all made guest appearances with Wynn. This was the first CBS variety television show to originate from Los Angeles, which was seen live on the west coast, but filmed via kinescope for distribution in the Midwest and East, as the national coaxial cable had yet to be completed. Wynn was also a rotating host of NBC's Four Star Revue from 1950 through 1952. \nAfter the end of Wynn's third television series, The Ed Wynn Show (a short-lived situation comedy on NBC's 1958–59 schedule), his son, actor Keenan Wynn, encouraged him to make a career change rather than retire. The comedian reluctantly began a career as a dramatic actor in television and movies. Father and son appeared in three productions, the first of which was the 1956 Playhouse 90 broadcast of Rod Serling's play Requiem for a Heavyweight. Ed was terrified of straight acting and kept goofing his lines in rehearsal. When the producers wanted to fire him, star Jack Palance said he would quit if they fired Ed. (However, unbeknownst to Wynn, supporting player Ned Glass was his secret understudy in case something did happen before air time.) On live broadcast night, Wynn surprised everyone with his pitch-perfect performance, and his quick ad libs to cover his mistakes. A dramatization of what happened during the production was later staged as an April 1960 Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse episode, \"The Man in the Funny Suit\", starring both senior and junior Wynns, with key figures involved in the original production also portraying themselves. Ed and his son also worked together in the Jose Ferrer film The Great Man, with Ed again proving his unexpected skills in drama.\n\nRequiem established Wynn as a serious dramatic actor who could easily hold his own with the best. His role in The Diary of Anne Frank (1959) won him an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor.\n\nAlso in 1959, Wynn appeared on Serling's TV series The Twilight Zone in \"One for the Angels\". Serling, a longtime admirer, had written that episode especially for him, and Wynn later in 1963 starred in the episode \"Ninety Years Without Slumbering\". For the rest of his life, Wynn skillfully moved between comic and dramatic roles. He appeared in feature films and anthology television, endearing himself to new generations of fans.","birthday":"1886-11-09","gender":"Male","name":"Ed Wynn","place_of_birth":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA ","tmdbID":5833,"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original//u0eEj1uzQNmSPQgBDcgGJaIHILR.jpg"},{"biography":"Carolyn Lawrence (born February 13, 1967) is an American actress and voice actress, who is known for her long-running voice role as Sandy Cheeks on the Nickelodeon TV Show SpongeBob SquarePants.   ,  .","birthday":"1967-02-13","gender":"Female","name":"Carolyn Lawrence","place_of_birth":null,"tmdbID":78799,"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original//7Ehx4bEO8loovbmbntXl0sBNjtj.jpg"},{"biography":"Clarence John Brown III (born January 5, 1959) is an American film, television and voice actor.

In a career spanning nine decades and continuing until shortly before his death, he appeared in more than 300 films and was among the last surviving stars of the silent film era. \nAt the height of a career that was marked by declines and comebacks, Rooney performed the role of Andy Hardy in a series of 16 films in the 1930s and 1940s that epitomized American family values. A versatile performer, he became a celebrated character actor later in his career. Laurence Olivier once said he considered Rooney \"the best there has ever been\". Clarence Brown, who directed him in two of his earliest dramatic roles, National Velvet and The Human Comedy, said he was \"the closest thing to a genius I ever worked with\".\n\nRooney first performed in vaudeville as a child and made his film debut at the age of six. At 14, he played Puck in the play and later the 1935 film adaptation of A Midsummer Night's Dream. Critic David Thomson hailed his performance as \"one of the cinema's most arresting pieces of magic\". In 1938, he co-starred in Boys Town. At 19, he was the first teenager to be nominated for an Oscar for his leading role in Babes in Arms, and he was awarded a special Academy Juvenile Award in 1939. At the peak of his career between the ages of 15 and 25, he made 43 films, which made him one of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's most consistently successful actors and a favorite of MGM studio head Louis B. Mayer.\n\nRooney was the top box-office attraction from 1939 to 1941 and one of the best-paid actors of that era, but his career would never again rise to such heights. Drafted into the Army during World War II, he served nearly two years entertaining over two million troops on stage and radio and was awarded a Bronze Star for performing in combat zones. Returning from the war in 1945, he was too old for juvenile roles but too short to be an adult movie star, and was unable to get as many starring roles. Nevertheless, Rooney's popularity was renewed with well-received supporting roles in films such as Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961), Requiem for a Heavyweight (1962), It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World (1963), and The Black Stallion (1979). In the early 1980s, he returned to Broadway in Sugar Babies and again became a celebrated star. Rooney made hundreds of appearances on TV, including dramas, variety programs, and talk shows, and won an Emmy in 1982 plus a Golden Globe for his role in Bill (1981).","birthday":"1920-09-23","gender":"Male","name":"Mickey Rooney","place_of_birth":"Brooklyn, New York City, New York, USA","tmdbID":1937,"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original//eYuayEC3xhXQf3Z1Cy6AVMEcgZb.jpg"},{"biography":"","birthday":"2000-11-28","gender":"Female","name":"Kaitlyn Bernard","place_of_birth":"Canada ","tmdbID":1467169,"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original//dllK1fxLKBW7Ijjou08O3K8tNvW.jpg"},{"biography":"Jorge García (born April 28, 1973, height 5' 11½\" (1,82 m)) is an American actor and comedian.

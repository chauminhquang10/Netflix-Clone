Through a career that has spanned nearly five decades, Miyazaki has attained international acclaim as a maker of animated feature films and, along with Isao Takahata, co-founded Studio Ghibli, an animation studio and production company. The success of Miyazaki's films has invited comparisons with American animator Walt Disney, British animator Nick Park as well as Robert Zemeckis, who pioneered Motion Capture animation, and he has been named one of the most influential people by Time Magazine. \nMiyazaki began his career at Toei Animation as an in-between artist for Gulliver's Travels Beyond the Moon where he pitched his own ideas that eventually became the movie's ending. He continued to work in various roles in the animation industry over the decade until he was able to direct his first feature film Lupin III: The Castle of Cagliostro which was published in 1979. After the success of his next film, Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, he co-founded Studio Ghibli where he continued to produce many feature films until Princess Mononoke whereafter he temporarily retired.\n\nWhile Miyazaki's films have long enjoyed both commercial and critical success in Japan, he remained largely unknown to the West until Miramax released his 1997 film, Princess Mononoke. Princess Mononoke was the highest-grossing film in Japan—until it was eclipsed by another 1997 film, Titanic—and the first animated film to win Picture of the Year at the Japanese Academy Awards. Miyazaki returned to animation with Spirited Away. The film topped Titanic's sales at the Japanese box office, also won Picture of the Year at the Japanese Academy Awards and was the first anime film to win an American Academy Award.\n\nMiyazaki's films often incorporate recurrent themes, such as humanity's relationship to nature and technology, and the difficulty of maintaining a pacifist ethic. Reflecting Miyazaki's feminism, the protagonists of his films are often strong, independent girls or young women. Miyazaki is a vocal critic of capitalism and globalization.[3] While two of his films, The Castle of Cagliostro and Castle in the Sky, involve traditional villains, his other films such as Nausicaa or Princess Mononoke present morally ambiguous antagonists with redeeming qualities.","birthday":"1941-01-05","gender":"Male","name":"Hayao Miyazaki","place_of_birth":"Tokyo, Japan","tmdbID":"608","__v":0,"createdAt":"2022-06-19T08:04:18.089Z","updatedAt":"2022-06-19T08:04:18.089Z"},{"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original//bF6RT5FvdzCRxRc6Ud6FC9JgcIh.jpg","knownFor":["62b18721cecc8b3bd8099a33","62b18721cecc8b3bd8099931"],"checked":false,"_id":"62aed881488f712204163198","biography":"Jonathan Liebesman was born in Johannesburg, South Africa on September 15, 1976. He would remain in his home country, studying filmmaking at the South African School of Motion Picture Medium and Live Performance, until 1996; that year, he traveled to New York City to visit his cousin who was attending New York University. Soon after the visit, Jonathan enrolled at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts. \nFor his student first film, Jonathan turned Roald Dahl's short story Genesis and Catastrophe (2000) into a 8-minute, award-winning short that help him land Hollywood representation; accolades included the 2000 Hollywood Film Festival's Young Filmmaker Award and the Austin Film Festival's Student Short Film Award.\n\nJonathan would make his feature-film debut in 2002 with Darkness Falls (2003), a dark twist on the Tooth Fairy tale that opened at #1 at the box office despite being critically panned. It also served as the big-screen debut for Emma Caulfield Ford, long a fan-favorite as Anya Jenkins on Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997).\n\nRings (2005), his short film that connected The Ring (2002) and its sequel, was first released as a bonus disc with the re-release of The Ring on DVD. The short caught the attention of Michael Bay and his production company, Platinum Dunes, and soon Jonathan was installed as the director of the company's project The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning (2006), a prequel to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003), the widely successful remake of the original.\n\nInitially announced as the director of the Friday the 13th reboot, Jonathan's next feature would instead be The Killing Room (2009) with Peter Stormare, Chloë Sevigny, Clea DuVall, Timothy Hutton, Nick Cannon and Shea Whigham. The psychological thriller played the festival circuit before being released on DVD in the United States.\n\nA few months before The Killing Room's Sundance world premiere in January 2009, Jonathan was announced as the director of Battle Los Angeles (2011), an alien-invasion film starring Aaron Eckhart and released by Columbia Pictures. The sci-fi/action film was a worldwide hit and put Jonathan in the running for a handful of big-studio pictures.\n\nBefore Battle LA's release, he had handed the job of directing Odysseus as Warner Bros., though that project remains in development at this time. Instead, Jonathan took the reins for Wrath of the Titans (2012), the sequel to successful but maligned Clash of the Titans (2010).","birthday":"1976-09-15","gender":"Male","name":"Jonathan Liebesman","place_of_birth":"Johannesburg, South Africa","tmdbID":"66739","__v":0,"createdAt":"2022-06-19T08:04:18.090Z","updatedAt":"2022-06-19T08:04:18.090Z"},{"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original//3npAesb4X5yvxPlUWRHTOFz9RCi.jpg","knownFor":["62b18721cecc8b3bd8099a0f","62b18721cecc8b3bd809990b"],"checked":false,"_id":"62aed881488f712204163199","biography":"Anthony Hemingway is an assistant director and director.","birthday":"","gender":"Male","name":"Anthony Hemingway","place_of_birth":"","tmdbID":"1216147","__v":0,"createdAt":"2022-06-19T08:04:18.090Z","updatedAt":"2022-06-19T08:04:18.090Z"},{"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/","knownFor":[],"checked":false,"_id":"62aed881488f71220416319a","biography":"","birthday":"","gender":"Not specified","name":"David Glover","place_of_birth":"","tmdbID":"2944693","__v":0,"createdAt":"2022-06-19T08:04:18.090Z","updatedAt":"2022-06-19T08:04:18.090Z"},{"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/","knownFor":["62b18721cecc8b3bd80998ec"],"checked":false,"_id":"62aed881488f71220416319b","biography":"","birthday":"","gender":"Not specified","name":"Jordan Graham","place_of_birth":"","tmdbID":"1335223","__v":0,"createdAt":"2022-06-19T08:04:18.090Z","updatedAt":"2022-06-19T08:04:18.090Z"},{"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original//sKfNzzahN7guw7aqIhc7xV7edfN.jpg","knownFor":["62b18721cecc8b3bd80998e8"],"checked":false,"_id":"62aed881488f71220416319c","biography":"","birthday":"","gender":"Not specified","name":"Renaud Gauthier","place_of_birth":"","tmdbID":"1209832","__v":0,"createdAt":"2022-06-19T08:04:18.091Z","updatedAt":"2022-06-19T08:04:18.091Z"},{"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original//90Tq9GYih9viOI825KgeV7PKIKG.jpg","knownFor":["62b18721cecc8b3bd80999ae"],"checked":false,"_id":"62aed881488f71220416319d","biography":"Tommy Wirkola (born 1979 in Alta, Norway) is a Norwegian filmmaker.","birthday":"1979-12-06","gender":"Male","name":"Tommy Wirkola","place_of_birth":"Alta, Norway","tmdbID":"76927","__v":0,"createdAt":"2022-06-19T08:04:18.091Z","updatedAt":"2022-06-19T08:04:18.091Z"},{"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original//aK2lYDBYhWU9MJdNV0y1EvXiNo0.jpg","knownFor":["62b18721cecc8b3bd8099a31","62b18721cecc8b3bd80998f8","62b18721cecc8b3bd80998ad"],"checked":false,"_id":"62aed881488f71220416319e","biography":"Nancy Jane Meyers is an American film director, producer and screenwriter.

Some of his other films include Sorcerer, Cruising, To Live and Die in L.A., Jade, Rules of Engagement, The Hunted, Bug, and Killer Joe. \nAs mentioned in Friedkin's voice-over commentary on the DVD re-release of Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo, Friedkin directed one of the last episodes of The Alfred Hitchcock Hour in 1965, called \"Off Season\". Hitchcock admonished Friedkin for not wearing a tie while directing.\n\nIn 1965 Friedkin moved to Hollywood and two years later released his first feature film, Good Times starring Sonny and Cher. Several other \"art\" films followed, including the adaptation of Mart Crowley's The Boys in the Band and most notably The Birthday Party, based on an unpublished screenplay by Harold Pinter, which he adapted from his own play. Friedkin, however, did not want to be known as an art house director, but rather for action and serious drama through stories about an America upended by crime, hypocrisy, the occult, and amorality. All of which he mounted up into his films to reflect what was going on in an America that was changing in the wake of Vietnam, the Sexual Revolution, and Watergate.\n\nIn 1971, his The French Connection was released to wide critical acclaim. Shot in a gritty style more suited for documentaries than Hollywood features, the film won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director. Friedkin followed up with 1973's The Exorcist, based on William Peter Blatty's best-selling novel, which revolutionized the horror genre and is considered by some critics to be one of the greatest horror movies of all time. The Exorcist was nominated for 10 Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director. It won the Best Screenplay and Best Sound Mixing.\n\nFollowing these two pictures, Friedkin, along with Francis Ford Coppola and Peter Bogdanovich, was deemed one of the premier directors of New Hollywood; In 1973 the trio announced the formation of an independent production company at Paramount, The Directors Company. Whereas Coppola directed The Conversation and Bogdanovich, the Henry James adaptation, Daisy Miller, Friedkin abruptly left the company, which was soon closed by Paramount. \n\nFriedkin's later movies did not achieve the same success. \n\nThroughout the 1980s and 1990s, Friedkin's films received mostly lackluster reviews and moderate ticket sales. However, his action/crime movie To Live and Die in L.A. (1985), starring William Petersen and Willem Dafoe, was a critical favorite and drew comparisons to Friedkin's own The French Connection (particularly for its car-chase sequence). In 2011 Friedkin directed Killer Joe, a black comedy written by Tracy Letts, and starring Matthew McConaughey. Killer Joe premiered at the 68th Venice International Film Festival, prior to its North American debut at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival. \n\nIn April 2013 Friedkin published a memoir, The Friedkin Connection. He was presented with a lifetime achievement award at the 70th Venice International Film Festival in September.","birthday":"1935-08-29","gender":"Male","name":"William Friedkin","place_of_birth":"Chicago, Illinois, USA","tmdbID":"15175","__v":0,"createdAt":"2022-06-19T08:04:18.098Z","updatedAt":"2022-06-19T08:04:18.098Z"},{"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original//embHCkQj1fs1PaISQSQQbi9TjHj.jpg","knownFor":["62b18721cecc8b3bd809999c"],"checked":false,"_id":"62aed882488f7122041631c9","biography":"Jonathan Charles \"Jon\" Turteltaub is an American film director and producer.

He was raised in an Army family, meaning that for most of his early life, his father — an officer in the Royal Engineers — was absent. Ridley's older brother, Frank, joined the Merchant Navy when he was still young and the pair had little contact. During this time the family moved around, living in (among other areas) Cumbria, Wales and Germany. He has a younger brother, Tony, also a film director. After the Second World War, the Scott family moved back to their native north-east England, eventually settling in Teesside (whose industrial landscape would later inspire similar scenes in Blade Runner). He enjoyed watching films, and his favourites include Lawrence of Arabia, Citizen Kane and Seven Samurai. Scott studied in Teesside from 1954 to 1958, at Grangefield Grammar School and later in West Hartlepool College of Art, graduating with a Diploma in Design. He progressed to an M.A. in graphic design at the Royal College of Art from 1960 to 1962. \nAt the RCA he contributed to the college magazine, ARK and helped to establish its film department. For his final show, he made a black and white short film, Boy and Bicycle, starring his younger brother, Tony Scott, and his father. The film's main visual elements would become features of Scott's later work; it was issued on the 'Extras' section of The Duellists DVD. After graduation in 1963, he secured a job as a trainee set designer with the BBC, leading to work on the popular television police series Z-Cars and the science fiction series Out of the Unknown. Scott was an admirer of Stanley Kubrick early in his development as a director. For his entry to the BBC traineeship, Scott remade Paths of Glory as a short film.\n\nHe was assigned to design the second Doctor Who serial, The Daleks, which would have entailed realising the famous alien creatures. However, shortly before Scott was due to start work, a schedule conflict meant that he was replaced on the serial by Raymond Cusick.\n\nAt the BBC, Scott was placed into a director training programme and, before he left the corporation, had directed episodes of Z-Cars, its spin-off, Softly, Softly, and adventure series Adam Adamant Lives!\n\nIn 1968, Ridley and Tony Scott founded Ridley Scott Associates (RSA), a film and commercial production company.Five members of the Scott family are directors, all working for RSA. Brother Tony has been a successful film director for more than two decades; sons, Jake and Luke are both acclaimed commercials directors as is his daughter, Jordan Scott. Jake and Jordan both work from Los Angeles and Luke is based in London.\n\nIn 1995, Shepperton Studios was purchased by a consortium headed by Ridley and Tony Scott, which extensively renovated the studios while also expanding and improving its grounds.","birthday":"1937-11-30","gender":"Male","name":"Ridley Scott","place_of_birth":"South Shields, County Durham, England, UK","tmdbID":"578","__v":0,"createdAt":"2022-06-19T08:04:18.098Z","updatedAt":"2022-06-19T08:04:18.098Z"},{"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original//ts06thbCv9Ug2mNpcbcrmLGRL4Q.jpg","knownFor":["62b18721cecc8b3bd8099918","62b18721cecc8b3bd8099858"],"checked":false,"_id":"62aed882488f7122041631ce","biography":"Bryan Singer (born September 17, 1965) is an American film director and producer.

He is widely acclaimed as one of Hollywood's most celebrated and influential film directors. He epitomized the group of filmmakers known as the New Hollywood, which included George Lucas, Martin Scorsese, Robert Altman, Woody Allen and William Friedkin, who emerged in the early 1970s with unconventional ideas that challenged contemporary filmmaking. \nHe co-authored the script for Patton, winning the Academy Award in 1970. His directorial fame escalated with the release of The Godfather in 1972. The film revolutionized movie-making in the gangster genre, garnering universal laurels from critics and public alike. It went on to win three Academy Awards, including his second, which he won for Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was instrumental in cementing his position as one of the prominent American film directors. Coppola followed it with an equally successful sequel The Godfather Part II, which became the first ever sequel to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. The film received yet higher praises than its predecessor, and gave him three Academy Awards—for Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Director and Best Picture. In the same year was released The Conversation, which he directed, produced and wrote. The film went on to win the Palme d'Or at the 1974 Cannes Film Festival. His next directorial venture was Apocalypse Now in 1979, and it was as notorious for its lengthy and troubled production as it was critically acclaimed for its vivid and stark depiction of the Vietnam War. It won his second Palme d'Or at the 1979 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nAlthough some of Coppola's ventures in the 1980s and early 1990s were critically lauded, Coppola's later work has not met the same level of critical and commercial success as his '70s films.\n\n ,  ","birthday":"1939-04-07","gender":"Male","name":"Francis Ford Coppola","place_of_birth":"Detroit, Michigan, USA","tmdbID":"1776","__v":0,"createdAt":"2022-06-19T08:04:18.110Z","updatedAt":"2022-06-19T08:04:18.110Z"},{"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original//akcugIHTLKZajrsq51uGGGzHEdv.jpg","knownFor":["62b18721cecc8b3bd80999c8","62b18721cecc8b3bd8099957","62b18721cecc8b3bd809989e"],"checked":false,"_id":"62aed882488f7122041631e6","biography":"​John Daniel Singleton (January 6, 1968-April 29, 2019) was an American film director, screenwriter, and producer.

He was raised in Oakland, California. His father was a musician in a country rock band and his mother was a photographer who also operated a day-care center. He is Jewish on his mother's side.\n\nAs a boy, he sang in the chorus of the San Francisco Opera. As a teenager, Trevorrow won awards from the Mill Valley Film Festival and the San Francisco Youth Film Festival.

Trevorrow's first theatrical release was with Reality Show, a 2004 documentary film about the failed production of a reality television show. Trevorrow sold his first spec script titled Tester to DreamWorks in 2006. In 2008, he paired up with Derek Connolly, ten years after they had first met as NYU students while working as interns on Saturday Night Live, to write a buddy cop film script called Cocked and Loaded. Trevorrow said that the experience was so enjoyable that he decided to give up solo screenwriting and work with Connolly.\n\nIn 2012, Trevorrow directed Safety Not Guaranteed, a film inspired by a classified advertisement which ran in a 1997 issue of Backwoods Home Magazine that read: \"Somebody to go back in time with me. This is not a joke. P.O. Box 322, Oakview, CA 93022. You'll get paid after we get back. Must bring your own weapons. Safety not guaranteed. I have only done this once before.\" The script was by Connolly, who intended for Trevorrow to direct it. The film received various accolades, including a nomination for Trevorrow for the Independent Spirit Award for Best First Feature. The film was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance, where it picked up the Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award. After the release of Safety Not Guaranteed, Trevorrow and Connolly were hired by the Walt Disney Company to write an as-yet unmade remake of the film Flight of the Navigator (1986). Trevorrow co-wrote and directed Jurassic World (2015), and also provided his voice for the film's character of Mr. DNA. Connolly and Trevorrow also co-wrote the screenplay for its sequel, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, which was released in June 2018 and for which Trevorrow is an executive producer.\n\nAfter Jurassic World, Trevorrow next directed The Book of Henry, which was written by Gregg Hurwitz.

His paternal grandparents were Polish. In 1967, the family moved to California, and young Gregor grew up near San Diego. His biggest influences as a kid were Franz Kafka's Metamorphosis and Black Sabbath's Master of Reality. He started his professional career as a guitarist for punk-rock bands, such as The Daredevils and The Little Kings, and also made his first films together with friends. After having developed a passion for filmmaking, he sold his guitar to buy a Super-8mm camera. Then Verbinski attended the prestigious UCLA Film School, from which he graduated in 1987 with his BFA in Film. His first professional directing jobs were music videos for alternative bands, such as L7, Bad Religion, and Monster Magnet. Then he moved to advertising and directed commercials for Nike, Canon, Skittles, United airlines and Coca-Cola. In 1993 he created the renowned Budweiser advertising campaign featuring croaking frogs, for which he was awarded the advertising Silver Lion at Cannes and also received four Clio Awards.\n\nVerbinski made his feature directorial debut with Mousehunt (1997), a remarkably visual cartoonish family comedy. His next effort, The Mexican (2001), came to a modest result. However, Verbinski bounced back with a hit thriller The Ring (2002), grossing over $230 million dollars worldwide. His biggest directorial success came with the Disney theme park ride based Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003), with a brilliant acting ensemble, grossing over $650 million dollars, and bringing five Oscar nominations and many other awards and nominations. Disney ordered two more films which Verbinski shot one after another on location in the Carribean islands, for which he had to endure both tetanus and typhoid immunization shots. After having survived several hurricanes, dealing with sick and injured actors, and troubleshooting after numerous technical difficulties of the epic-scale project, Verbinski delivered. He employed the same stellar cast in the sequel Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (2006) and the third installment of the 'Pirates' franchise Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007).\n\nGore Verbinski does not like publicity.

One of the major figures of the New Hollywood era, he is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential directors in film history. Scorsese's body of work explores themes such as Italian-American identity, Catholic concepts of guilt and redemption, faith, machismo, nihilism, crime and sectarianism. Many of his films are known for their depiction of violence and the liberal use of profanity. Scorsese has also dedicated his life to film preservation and film restoration by founding the nonprofit organization The Film Foundation in 1990, as well as the World Cinema Foundation in 2007 and the African Film Heritage Project in 2017. \nScorsese studied at New York University (NYU), where he received a bachelor's degree in English literature in 1964, and received a master's degree in fine arts in film from NYU's Tisch School of the Arts in 1968. In 1967 Scorsese's first feature film Who's That Knocking at My Door was released and was accepted into the Chicago Film Festival, where critic Roger Ebert saw it and called it \"a marvelous evocation of American city life, announcing the arrival of an important new director\".\n\nHe has established a filmmaking history involving repeat collaborations with actors and film technicians, including nine films made with Robert De Niro. His films with De Niro are the psychological thriller Taxi Driver (1976), the biographical sports drama Raging Bull (1980), the satirical black comedy The King of Comedy (1982), the musical drama New York, New York (1977), the psychological thriller Cape Fear (1991), and the crime films Mean Streets (1973), Goodfellas (1990), Casino (1995) and The Irishman (2019). Scorsese has also been noted for his collaborations with actor Leonardo DiCaprio, having directed him in five films: the historical epic Gangs of New York (2002), the Howard Hughes biography The Aviator (2004), the crime thriller The Departed (2006), the psychological thriller Shutter Island (2010), and the Wall Street black comedy The Wolf of Wall Street (2013). The Departed won Scorsese an Academy Award for Best Director, and for Best Picture. Scorsese is also known for his long-time collaboration with film editor Thelma Schoonmaker, who has edited every Scorsese film beginning with Raging Bull. Scorsese's other film work includes the black comedy After Hours (1985), the romantic drama The Age of Innocence (1993), the children's adventure drama Hugo (2011), and the religious epics The Last Temptation of Christ (1988), Kundun (1997) and Silence (2016).","birthday":"1942-11-17","gender":"Male","name":"Martin Scorsese","place_of_birth":"Queens, New York, USA","tmdbID":"1032","__v":0,"createdAt":"2022-06-19T08:04:18.115Z","updatedAt":"2022-06-19T08:04:18.115Z"},{"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original//cOInNiOSrSEaLfQtqmJWnA1sRKY.jpg","knownFor":["62b18721cecc8b3bd8099a74","62b18721cecc8b3bd80999e2","62b18721cecc8b3bd809987d"],"checked":false,"_id":"62aed882488f71220416320a","biography":"Léa Mysius (born 4 April 1989) is a French director and writer.","birthday":"1989-04-04","gender":"Female","name":"Léa Mysius","place_of_birth":"Bordeaux, France","tmdbID":"1702466","__v":0,"createdAt":"2022-06-19T08:04:18.115Z","updatedAt":"2022-06-19T08:04:18.115Z"},{"image":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original//zJaLbNHLoQMhCAeJhn1J1B0xrup.jpg","knownFor":["62b18721cecc8b3bd8099a72","62b18721cecc8b3bd80999e1","62b18721cecc8b3bd809987c"],"checked":false,"_id":"62aed882488f71220416320b","biography":"Tate Taylor is an American filmmaker and actor.
